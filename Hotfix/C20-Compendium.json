Despairing for the lives lost on both sides, a troll knight makes the rain restore life to the wounded on the battlefield.

Second, the edict cannot involve direct selfharm or direct violence toward loved ones. An edict to &ldquo;kill yourself&rdquo; or &ldquo;murder your family&rdquo; fails immediately, but &ldquo;avenge our father&rsquo;s death&rdquo; would take hold even if the creature that killed their father will surely kill the target of the Geas as well.<br><br></p>\n<p>A Geas applied to an inanimate or non-sentient target typically will not be broken and does not require an accompanying curse.

Contractual Unleashings are best used with great caution, as the Dreaming gives little heed to anything other than their core demand. For example, a sidhe noble looking for a warrior willing to undertake an oath to complete a difficult quest might demand that the Dreaming reveal to him one who would be willing to assent to the contract, and the Unleashing might comply&hellip;by revealing a fearless blackguard of a redcap. Unleashings directed at existing contracts are more common. Something like &ldquo;show me Sir Caobahn&rsquo;s progress upon our matter of business&rdquo; is a common Unleashing, as are &ldquo;bring the oathbreaker Silas Miller to my court, now&rdquo; and the fairly risky &ldquo;I call upon the Dreaming to send some aid to speed this matter toward successful resolution.&rdquo;</p>",

The precise expression of this manipulation of destiny is always difficult to predict, but the signs cannot be mistaken.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The Realm used determines who or what is blessed or cursed. If a person is blessed, then she&rsquo;ll gain one automatic success per success rolled on Fate Fire&rsquo;s activation at an auspicious moment of the Storyteller&rsquo;s choosing at some point during the current story. If cursed, each success removes a success on a roll in a dire time of difficulty of the Storyteller&rsquo;s choosing, also at some point during the same story. Furthermore, all rolls for the rest of the scene after Fate Fire kicks in add or subtract one automatic success (depending on whether a blessing or curse has been laid). Blessings and curses affect objects in the same way, but tend to center on uses of the object or attempts to do something momentous to or within locales, rather than attaching to a particular person. Fate Fire can linger on an object for an indefinite time, until a properly fortuitous moment arises. An object or individual can&rsquo;t have more than one use of Fate Fire hanging over them at a time, although a second use of Fate Fire can be used to &ldquo;fight&rdquo; a hanging blessing or curse, canceling successes on a one-for-one basis. This costs one point of Glamour to attempt, however.<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Storyteller Advice: Fate Fire<br></strong></p>\n<p>Fate Fire is more than simply a hanging bundle of extra successes or a nasty forced botch. It&rsquo;s Glamour woven into the tapestry of destiny itself by the deft hands of a master seer, and exists to enforce tales of staggering triumph in the darkest of hours, or terrible defeat at the cusp of victory. The triggers of the effects of this cantrip aren&rsquo;t intended to go off at random, but rather when it would be most dramatic. When the players are leaning forward across the table, sweating as they pick over the results of their dice roll and just beginning to curse or cheer &mdash; that&rsquo;s when you drop Fate Fire on them.</p>",

A target of Dictum may be able to resist the order, but most do not have the will and become at least a temporary servant to the changeling.</p>\n<p><br>A redcap commands a door to close and remain locked, trapping her victim inside. A sidhe knight orders his squire to deliver a poisoned letter to a rival. The boggan tracker orders the rain to stop as she follows a trail through the woods.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The target determines the Realm, which can be used on inanimate and non-sentient targets as well as people, fae, Prodigals, etc. After the Kithain issues a simple, directed voice command, the target must complete the action. Anything which shocks the target&rsquo;s conscience or would result in immediate mortal harm prompts a Willpower roll (difficulty 9). If successful, she resists the Dictum but spends the turn concentrating on remaining in control.</p>\n<p><br>Changelings and supernatural creatures can spend a point of Willpower to delay complying with Dictum for a turn and continue to act on their own volition. Should the caster be killed or knocked unconscious prior to the target acting on the order, the cantrip&rsquo;s power fades.</p>",

Although Echoes is purchased as a Flaw, it often has a beneficial side effect. The points received with this Flaw reflect the level of your connection to the Dreaming and even to Arcadia. The effects of this Flaw are cumulative. A character with a five-point Flaw also suffers the setbacks of the two through four-point Flaws.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Minor: </strong>Salt thrown over the shoulder for good luck protects a mortal from faerie powers. The same is true of bread. Your cantrips cannot affect any mortal who does so for the duration of the scene. Cantrips simply do not work, and may backfire. Any mortal knowing your full name can command three tasks from you, which you must accomplish before achieving freedom from that mortal&rsquo;s influence. However, you need only follow the exact wording of the mortal&rsquo;s request, not the desire behind the request. (2 pts)</p>\n<p><br><strong>Moderate: </strong>You may not enter a home without invitation, unless you perform some small favor for the owners of the dwelling. The invitation to enter a home may come from anyone at all, it need not be the owner. Cold iron in a residence will bar you from entering the building; religious symbols have the same effect and will prevent you from physically or magically affecting mortals. The sound of ringing church bells causes you pain, just as cold iron does (at this level only pain, but as a four-point Flaw, you gain one point of Banality for every turn you endure the sound). (3 pts)</p>\n<p><br><strong>Serious: </strong>Four-leaf clovers in the possession of a mortal prevent you from using your Arts against that mortal. However, four-leaf clovers picked by you are sure to bring good luck (you cannot botch) for as long as the petals of the clover remain intact. This luck only remains for as long as the clover is worn. Any mortal wearing their coat inside out is invisible to you. You may not cross running water, save by means of a bridge. Religious symbols are now repellent to you, forcing you away from those who wear them. The shadow of such a symbol falling upon your person causes one Health Level of chimerical damage for each turn the shadow touches you. You may no longer enter holy ground without suffering chimerical injuries (one Health Level per turn,) though this damage may be soaked. (4 pts)</p>\n<p><br><strong>Extreme: </strong>Wherever you dwell, mushrooms bloom in a faerie ring &mdash; even on your plush carpet. The Mists no longer hide your powers. Many people will remember you if you use your Glamour while around them. Chimerical creatures tend to become more real for you than for others, and their attacks cause real and permanent injury. Contrarily, your chimerical weapons can cause damage to anyone, even mortals. People will likely follow you if you request it, often gaining a dazed look and following you even into dangerous situations. Your difficulties in casting cantrips might be reduced by a substantial amount (Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion), but those wearing cold iron or religious symbols are immune to any Arts you might use. You must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) in order to enter holy ground. Even if you succeed in your Willpower roll, actual physical damage (one Health Level per turn) occurs whenever you enter holy ground. (5 pts)</p>",

Officiating a contract between other individuals requires the relevant ratings in applicable Realms (thus, sanctioning a contract between a troll and a mortal would require Fae and Actor), though the changeling may still weave in Prop or Nature as well if she desires.<br><br></p>\n<p>Done Deal can only sanctify formal agreements between the changeling and other characters, or between other characters who have agreed that the changeling should act as a witness or notary to the contract. Casual agreements (&ldquo;sure, I&rsquo;ll pick up the check&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to make it to your little-league game&rdquo;) aren&rsquo;t valid targets for Done Deal &mdash; at bare minimum, a formal promise is required.<br><br></p>\n<p>When an individual breaks an agreement bound by Done Deal, they normally suffer a number of automatic botches equal to the successes on the cantrip&rsquo;s activation roll, which the Storyteller doles out at the most dramatically appropriate and poetically ironic moments. If the oath was sanctified around a place (with the Scene Realm), that place becomes the oathbreaker&rsquo;s bane; for a number of scenes equal to the successes on the cantrip&rsquo;s activation roll, while the oathbreaker is in the binding location, 1s, 2s, and 3s all subtract successes and can create botches. (These scenes are only &lsquo;spent&rsquo; when the oathbreaker is present; one cannot wait out a Contract curse by any means save total avoidance of the baneful ground.) If the oath was sanctified around an object, that object becomes the oathbreaker&rsquo;s bane. All attempts by the oathbreaker to use it suffer the same penalty as with cursed ground, and any attempts to use the object against the oathbreaker gain a number of bonus dice equal to the successes on the activation roll.</p>",
