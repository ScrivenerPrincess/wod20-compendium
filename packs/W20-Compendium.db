Werewolves are not accorded adulthood or respect until they pass this seminal rite; they are mere cubs until that time. They are not even considered true Garou, and Shadow Lords do not refer to them as such until this rite is completed. Similarly, a cub is not a member of any tribe until his Rite of Passage. A male cub born to the Black Furies, for example, becomes a member of whatever tribe will offer him a place among them by use of this rite.</p>\n<p>During a Rite of Passage, the cubs must complete a dangerous quest meant to prove that they have the courage, honor, and wisdom befitting a werewolf. However, few cubs undergo this rite alone. They are often joined by their pack-to-be, other cubs who are also coming of age. The ritemaster commands the would-be pack to go out into the world with a definite goal to achieve, and he forbids it to return until it has tried its best to accomplish this goal. Different tribes impose different goals, although multi-tribal septs usually reach a compromise. A Wendigo rite often takes the form of a vision quest, while the Get of Fenris commonly send their cubs into combat with Wyrm-spawn. Invisible spirits sometimes accompany the cubs in order to watch over them and report their doings to the elders.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the cubs succeed in their quest, a ritemaster performs this rite upon them, marking them with a pictogram that brands them as full-fledged Garou.

In preparation, the Garou chant, howl, and tell tales of bravery. Also common is a ritual bloodletting, wherein each Garou cuts herself and sheds some of her blood into a large bowl. The mingled blood is then used to paint pictograms on the forehead or breastbone of each of the hunters. At dawn, Gaia sends the waiting sept a sign proclaiming the target of the Great Hunt. This sign may come in any form, from a vision seen by an entranced Wendigo ritemaster to a news story flashing on the screen of an old television in a Bone Gnawer caern. Although the person or creature chosen by Gaia is almost always associated with the Wyrm, Gaia demands on rare occasions that one of her own be sacrificed in the Great Hunt. Only the greatest war- riors are ever chosen as the targets of a Great Hunt, and Gaia demands such a sacrifice from her children only in times of great need, for the freed spirit of such a warrior is said to transform immediately into an avenging angel for Gaia.</p>\n<p>The Garou have only until midnight to complete the Great Hunt.

This rite, Enchant the Forest, awakens the spirits of the land and urges them to protect the Wyld. These spirits awaken and move to resist any human settlements in the area.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Springs dry out. The winter grows harsher than ever before, yet the trees are remarkably fast-growing and resilient. Food decays and rots in no time, and vermin and insects infest the area. Attempts to construct power lines fail inexplicably. On the rare occasions when cell phones are able to get any reception at all, their calls are interrupted by threatening screeches of static and disturbing whispers. Humans eventually either leave or die, and the wilderness reclaims its lost property.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The area seems haunted for years afterwards. The trees are dark and threatening, and strange sounds emanate from the woods at night. The spirits, once roused, don&rsquo;t rest again for a very long time. Superstitious tales of haunted lands circulate, and many humans give the area wide berth. Unfortunately, many others may become interested &mdash; government agencies, paranormal investigators, and other supernatural beings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ritemaster must take a twig from a tree never seen by human eyes, make a container from the belly of an animal never hunted by humans, and fill the pouch with water from a pond never touched by mankind. He then stirs the water, pours it close to the borders of the wild woods, and calls on the spirits of nature to awaken and defend themselves. He sends messengers to the north, south, east and west, to call to the spirits there. The ritemaster must sing to the spirits for three days.</p>","details":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard roll. The immediate effects of this rite last for a full year, if they are not disrupted by some sort of supernatural intervention.

Except in special circumstances, your allies don&rsquo;t usually know you are a werewolf (that knowledge would probably alter the relationship for the worse), but they may know that you have contacts and skills that most people don&rsquo;t, and they will come to you for favors. After all, friends help each other out, right?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You&rsquo;ve got a closer relationship with your allies than with contacts &mdash; they&rsquo;re your friends, and they&rsquo;ll listen to you. Convincing your fishing buddy that a local refinery is spilling toxins into a major fishery can do wonders for your cause when he&rsquo;s an aide in the governor&rsquo;s office. Of course, just as your allies are more loyal and directly useful than your contacts, they can also require more in return. But you&rsquo;d help your buddies out, right?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You should work out who your allies are at the beginning of the game, as well as how you know them. Maybe they&rsquo;re old brothers-in-arms or friends from a local environmental society. Maybe (if your Allies rating is 5) you&rsquo;re an old hunting buddy of the governor.</p>","details":"<p>Allies may be pooled among a pack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100.035%;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 44.2646%;\"><col style=\"width: 55.7354%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>●</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">One ally, of moderate influence and power (doctor or veterinarian, local activist)</p>\n<strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-548941bf-7fff-1237-9ec7-9c22992432a0\"></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>●●</td>\n<td>Two allies, both of moderate power (district ranger, deputy sheriff, popular blogger)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>●●●</td>\n<td>Three allies, one of them quite influential (newspaper editor, local philanthropist)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>●●●●</td>\n<td>Four allies, one of them very influential (city councilman, military base commander)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>●●●●●</td>\n<td>Five allies, one of them extremely influential (mayor, senator's aide)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","type":"wod.types.background","level":"","value":0,"max":5,"isrollable":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.I7vPOQGQBka2HCkJ"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2csczd3zfu5"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.4.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675989360852,"modifiedTime":1677870591119,"lastModifiedBy":"N9YazhkOc491aftw"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"N9YazhkOc491aftw":3},"_id":"StnrOTlB5XoedqnQ"}

Unlike other pooled Backgrounds, the pack spends all of the points that members have invested in this Trait to determine their totem&rsquo;s power.</p>\n<p>Each totem has a Background cost rating; the pack must spend that amount to ally with that totem. Some totems are willing to lend great powers to their adherents; their point costs are correspondingly greater. See Pack Totems (p. 373) for a list of possible totems. In addition to their Totem bonuses, all beginning totems have a base of eight points to divide among Rage, Willpower, and Gnosis. The totem also begins with the Airt Sense and Re-form Charms. Apart from bestowing power, totems start out somewhat aloof from the pack, and they have little influence among spirits, unless the players buy a closer connection with Background points. With time, roleplaying, and experience points, pack totems can grow in power as their pack grows in Rank and influence. Some totems can even become the totems of whole septs or &mdash; in legendary circumstances &mdash; even tribes.</p>\n<p>Most of the powers that totems bestow are available to only one pack member at a time. At the end of each turn, the Garou with the power declares who the power may be given to next turn (assuming that she doesn&rsquo;t keep it).

Summoning spirits involves complex rituals, long periods of meditation, and tribal mantra chanting. Within the Umbra, this process is far easier. This rite compels spirits to seek those who call them. Furthermore, the spirit cannot escape its caller once the summoning is completed successfully, and it must attend the mystic. Many spirits, particularly minor ones, are too weak to resist a powerful summoning. Powerful ones come out of curiosity. The chance of a successful summoning depends upon the skill of the mystic, the power of the spirit, and the strength of the area&rsquo;s Gauntlet.</p>","details":"<p>The ritemaster must pierce the Gauntlet just as if he were entering the Umbra (Gnosis roll against the local Gauntlet level). A mystic already within the Umbra is not required to pierce the Gauntlet. The power level of the spirit determines the difficulty level of a successful summoning. The Storyteller can determine difficulty from the following chart:</p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Spirit Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Difficulty</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gaffling</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jaggling</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Totem avatar</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Incarna</td>\n<td>8-9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Celestine avatar</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For each hour the Garou spends invoking the spirit, his difficulty drops by one. No difficulty may fall below 3. The player must then make a Gnosis roll and achieve as many successes as possible, with the following results:</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100.035%; height: 100.8px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 18.5639%;\"><col style=\"width: 81.0858%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.8px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\"><strong>Successes</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.8px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">Spirit comes eventually and is initially hostile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.8px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">Spirit manifests quickly, but it is still initially hostile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.8px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">Spirit comes immediately and is neutral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.8px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">Spirit comes immediately and is passively benign</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.8px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.8px;\">Spirit comes immediately and is friendly</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A botched roll is likely to have disastrous results.

In the past, this fetish took the form of palmtop digital assistants or powerbooks; modern iterations of the fetish are generally cell phones or digital tablets. This bee spirit creates a hive file structure in an Umbral space around the device, which can store and organize various rites before completion and then &ldquo;execute&rdquo; the rite at a later time. The Glass Walker simply has to use the PUDA to &ldquo;record&rdquo; the rite in some fashion, such as with a camera application. When finished, the rite does not have any effect, but (if successful) is then stored in the PUDA and can have its effect come to pass with the click of a touch-sensitive pad any time thereafter.

At the Storyteller&rsquo;s option, other more obscure rites may be compatible as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each rite stored on the PUDA requires some spiritual energy to be preserved, which is taken from the Glass Walker using it in the form of a single temporary point of Gnosis. This Gnosis does not restore in the usual manner, but is returned the moment that a rite is successfully ex- ecuted. If the execution fails and the rite is lost, the Gnosis goes with it, but may be regained in the usual fashion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On top of all this, the PUDA also works as a normal digital device.</p>","details":"","isequipped":false,"ismagical":false,"isweapon":false,"type":"wod.types.fetish","level":"4","value":0,"max":5,"gnosis":8,"difficulty":"6"},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.UQfeLBSq4XvDzxbd"},"cf":{"id":"temp_nmv8fydie7g","path":"Fetishes#/CF_SEP/Level Four","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.4.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677874282173,"modifiedTime":1677878145039,"lastModifiedBy":"N9YazhkOc491aftw"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"N9YazhkOc491aftw":3},"_id":"ajdW8VF1fDk07Vgj"}

A character with high Pure Breed looks and carries himself like an archetypal member of his tribe &mdash; however, if he does not join that tribe, any benefits of Pure Breed are removed by the tribe&rsquo;s totem. Many werewolves with Pure Breed can trace their ancestry directly, while others resemble distant ancestors who cannot be connected without a degree of genealogical exactitude that is lost to the Garou.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some tribes place more value on good breeding than others, but Pure Breed is almost universally respected. It&rsquo;s a mystical trait, and werewolves can tell instinctively whose blood is particularly pure. Of course, Garou expect those of pure blood to live up to the standards set by their noble ancestors. They frown on those who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t accept the challenge.</p>","details":"<table style=\"width: 99.9306%;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 30.8593%;\"><col style=\"width: 69.1407%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>●</td>\n<td>You have your father's eyes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>●●</td>\n<td>Your grandfather made a name for himself at the Battle of Bloody Ford, and you carry that name with pride.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>●●●</td>\n<td>Your pedigree is blessed with pillars of the Garou Nation, and the blood tells.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>●●●●</td>\n<td>You could be dressed as a beggar and still command respect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>●●●●●</td>\n<td>The greatest of heroes live on in you.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","type":"wod.types.background","level":"","value":0,"max":5,"isrollable":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.gxXKjVMLjdXsP8v1"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2csczd3zfu5"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.4.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1676077503334,"modifiedTime":1677870591810,"lastModifiedBy":"N9YazhkOc491aftw"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"N9YazhkOc491aftw":3},"_id":"eGoL2SLfWSirDonU"}

Simply reciting the rite draws the attention of the Wyrm&rsquo;s servants, and actually performing the rite has been known to prove fatal. Only the most powerful and wise mystics dare lead such an undertaking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A powerful Theurge is almost always selected to perform this most sacred of rites. Many Garou must channel their energy through a powerful leader to have even a hope of success. Whole packs have been known to die in the agony of failed attempts.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the physical focus for the heart of the caern is chosen, the area must be cleansed of all taints in preparation for its transformation. All Garou participating in the rite must undergo a Rite of Cleansing, at minimum. The ritemaster performs a series of minor rituals, meditations, and other physical preliminaries to prepare for her awesome task.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The sept must post sentries, for servants of the Wyrm almost invariably attempt to disrupt such a great rite. Only the mightiest warriors are chosen for such an assignment, and their protection is critical to the success of the rite. The leader of the rite is helpless while he chants a long litany of verses designed to draw a great spirit into the prepared caern. Although it is possible to create a specific type of caern, most leaders leave this choice to Gaia and accept whatever caern she grants the sept.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rite must be performed between the hours of sunset and sunrise during the waxing of the moon. Only the Black Spiral Dancers create caerns during the moon&rsquo;s waning.</p>","details":"<p>The rite lasts from dusk until dawn. As the sun breaks over the horizon, the ritemaster makes a Wits + Rituals roll at difficulty 8 (modified downward by one for every five Garou participating in the rite and spending Gnosis over and above the 13 necessary participants, to a minimum of difficulty 4). The number of successes gained determines the level of the resulting caern:</p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Successes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-3</td>\n<td>Level one</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-6</td>\n<td>Level two</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-8</td>\n<td>Level three</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td>Level four</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because an enormous amount of Gnosis is needed to break through the Gauntlet and empower the new caern, a minimum of 13 Garou, one for each moon of the year, must participate in the rite. At the end of the rite, the participating Garou channel Gnosis into the nascent caern &mdash; a total of 100 points of Gnosis is necessary to awaken the sacred site. If an insufficient amount of Gnosis is offered, the rite&rsquo;s participants begin to suffer aggravated wounds as their life-force is sacrificed to create the caern. Each wound counts as three more Gnosis points toward the total. The complete the ritual, each of the 13 core participants must sacrifice a dot of permanent Gnosis.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such is the damaged state of the world that the Rite of Caern Building can no longer naturally awaken a level five caern &mdash; only an additional offering of Gnosis can bring that sort of purity and power back to the dying earth. Offering an additional 100 points of Gnosis &mdash; 200 Gnosis in total &mdash; empowers the rite, creating a caern one level higher than the ritemaster&rsquo;s successes would otherwise indicate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The dangers of the rite are many. Failure scours the bodies and spirits of all Garou involved in the rite, both those donating Gnosis and those protecting them, inflict- ing four levels of lethal damage from spiritual backlash. A botch inflicts seven levels of lethal damage; those driven below Incapacitated by this damage suffer severe Battle Scars (see p. 259).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Minions of the Wyrm ultimately pose the greatest threat to the rite. As soon as it begins, all Wyrm-corrupted beings (Banes, fomori, Black Spiral Dancers, even particu- larly degenerate vampires or depraved ghosts) for miles around become aware of the rite; many will stop at nothing to prevent its completion. The Garou can expect a siege lasting at least until dawn, and likely longer.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If a player&rsquo;s character should somehow assume the role of ritemaster and succeed, she receives three points of Glory Renown, five points of Honor Renown, and seven points of Wisdom Renown. Anyone else participating in the rite receives five points of Glory Renown and three points of Honor Renown.

A Fate is always something significant, but it&rsquo;s as likely to be dark and infamous as it is to be full of glory. In these times of Apocalypse, the Garou cannot afford to sacrifice even one warrior, no matter how dark the portents surrounding them are. However, even those with terrible fates often prove to be some of the greatest Garou, perhaps because they try so hard to defy their fate. Some even succeed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the fame or infamy these prophecies garner you, once per game session you may use this Background to add successes to any roll that either failed or achieved fewer successes than were required. The player rolls his rating in this Background (difficulty 8) and adds any successes to those that were achieved in the original failed roll. If this means the action succeeds, the player should describe what fortuitous events caused him to succeed. If the Storyteller feels the player&rsquo;s actions run against what he is destined to do, she may choose to disallow the use of the background.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Fate is pooled among the pack, each member may call on this Background once per game session. If the action failed involves the entire pack in some way, then the player may draw on an amount of Fate up to the highest individual Fate in the pack. If the character is acting on her own, the player can only draw on an amount of Fate up to the lowest individual Fate in the pack (to a minimum of one). In a pack with pooled Fate, any character can raise her personal Fate with experience points, much like the Totem Background. However, she can only raise it up to the same level as the highest Fate in the pack &mdash; if no member of the pack starts with more than three dots of Fate, no pack member can ever buy Fate up to four or five dots.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Packs tend to garner prophecies of greater proportions than individuals. This is not only because of the greater weight a pack can swing compared to a single werewolf, but also because the Garou tend to see a pack&rsquo;s accomplishments as more legitimate than those of just one person. For roleplaying purposes, consider the pack&rsquo;s Fate to be equal to that of the highest Fate rating in the pack.</p>","details":"<p>Fate may be pooled among a pack.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100.035%;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 38.9495%;\"><col style=\"width: 61.0527%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>●</td>\n<td>Your pack will be involved in an event that will make you know to the entire Garou Nation.

Such moon bridges are vital links among the sacred spaces of Gaia. Once per year, a caern must renew its connection with other caerns to which it wishes to maintain moon bridges. This rite is always held during a moot, and it must be enacted simultaneously by both participating caerns.</p>\n<p>The primary requirement to open a moon bridge is a pathstone. Pathstones are found in the Umbra, and they are often the objects of quests. These extraordinarily rare stones resemble flat pearls with the imprint of a wolf's paw on one side. It is possible to steal a pathstone from a caern, but such a theft is considered blasphemous, and it may well result in a war between two septs.</p>\n<p>The rite establishes (or reestablishes) a spiritual connection between the pathstones of two separate caerns by way of the caerns&rsquo; totem spirits. At the rite&rsquo;s culmination, a moon bridge opens between the two participating caerns. During this time, Garou from both septs can travel between the caerns to join in a wild revel. Moon bridges allow Garou to traverse distances in 1/1000th the normal time required.

These trials represent the seven gates that bar the way to the Underworld. Such trials vary dramatically from tribe to tribe, but there are always a variety of challenges presented to the members. One test might involve facing a Bane in combat, while another challenge might consist of finding a fetish lost within the Deep Umbra. Each test requires the participants to relinquish something of themselves, be it a cherished personal fetish, an old grudge or false pride. If the Garou can win their way past these challenge gates, they can renew the Earth, banishing the winter-spirits and paving the way for the green, growing season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the end of the rite, the werewolves return to their bodies. At this time many tribes seek out Garou Kinfolk, or other humans and wolves, and reacquaint themselves with the joys of the flesh, celebrating the incredible beauty of life and the necessity of its continuation in future generations.
