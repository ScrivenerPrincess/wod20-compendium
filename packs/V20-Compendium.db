Botching this roll is even more catastrophic; the heightened frenzy grows so extreme that not even expending Willpower curbs its duration or effects.

While no longer vulnerable to frenzy, the character cannot use or regain Willpower and becomes increasingly lethargic.

By concentrating, the Kindred bursts her target&rsquo;s blood vessels and fills his lungs with vitae that strangles him from within. The blood actually constricts the target&rsquo;s body from the inside as it floods through his system; thus, it works even on unbreathing Kindred. Until the target collapses in agony or death throes, this power has no visible effect, and many Kindred like it because it leaves no trace of their presence.</p>","details":"<p>Mechanically, this power works the same as the warrior version except as follows: First, the roll is the Assamite&rsquo;s Manipulation versus the target&rsquo;s Intelligence.

If the Assamite spends a Willpower point and continues to roll even after the target has lost all her temporary Willpower, additional successes strip the target of one dot of permanent Willpower. This represents the most damage that this power can inflict in a single night regardless of successes, but a target who has lost all of her Willpower dots through use of Dagon&rsquo;s Call on successive nights is reduced to a mindless husk.<br><br>As with the warrior version, the Assamite need not be within the target&rsquo;s presence to trigger this attack.<br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior Version:</strong></em><br>The vampire must touch her target prior to using Dagon&rsquo;s Call.

The vampire creates an empathic connection with a beast, thereby allowing him to communicate or issue simple commands. The Kindred locks eyes with the animal, transmitting his desires through sheer force of will. Although it isn&rsquo;t necessary to actually &ldquo;speak&rdquo; in chirps, hisses, or barks, some vampires find that doing so helps strengthen the connection with the animal. Eye contact must be maintained the entire time; if it&rsquo;s broken, the Kindred must re-establish contact to continue communication.<br><br></p>\n<p>The simpler the creature, the more difficult it becomes to connect with the animal&rsquo;s Beast. Mammals, predatory birds, and larger reptiles are relatively easy to communicate with. Insects, invertebrates, and most fish are just too simple to connect with.<br><br></p>\n<p>Feral Whispers provides no guarantees that an animal will want to deal with the vampire, nor does it ensure that the animal will pursue any requests the vampire makes of it. Still, it does at least make the creature better disposed toward the Kindred. The manner in which the vampire presents his desires to the animal often depends on the type of creature. A Kindred can often bully smaller beasts into heeding commands, but he&rsquo;s better off couching orders for large predators as requests.<br><br></p>\n<p>If the vampire successfully uses the power, the animal performs the command to the best of its ability and intellect. Only the very brightest creatures understand truly complex directives (orders dealing with conditional situations or requiring abstract logic). Commands that the animal does understand remain deeply implanted, however, and guide its behavior for some time.</p>","details":"<p>No roll is necessary to talk with an animal, but the character must establish eye contact (see p. 152) first. Issuing commands requires a Manipulation + Animal Ken roll. The difficulty depends on the creature: Predatory mammals (wolves, cats, vampire bats) are difficulty 6, other mammals and predatory birds (rats, owls) are difficulty 7, and other birds and reptiles (pigeons, snakes) are difficulty 8. This difficulty is reduced by one if the character speaks to the animal in its &ldquo;native tongue,&rdquo; and can be adjusted further by circumstances and roleplaying skill (we highly recommend that all communication between characters and animals be roleplayed).<br><br></p>\n<p>The number of successes the player achieves dictates how strongly the character&rsquo;s command affects the animal. One success is sufficient to have a cat follow an individual and lead the character to the same location, three successes are enough to have a raven spy on a target for weeks, and five successes ensure that a grizzly ferociously guards the entrance to the character&rsquo;s wilderness haven for some months.<br><br>The character&rsquo;s Nature plays a large part in how he approaches these conversations. The character might try intimidating, teasing, cajoling, or rationalizing. The player should understand that he does not simply play his character in these situations, but the Beast Within as well.<br><br></p>\n<p>Using this power cannot force an animal to do something against its nature, or to force a creature to risk its life. While the aforementioned grizzly would stand guard to the vampire&rsquo;s haven and even fight for it, it would not do so against obviously superior numbers or something overwhelmingly supernatural. A predatory bird might be convinced to harry a target, but would definitely not hold ground. A docile dog or skittish cat would have no problem with reporting something it had seen, but it wouldn&rsquo;t enter combat unless given no other option &mdash; though it would likely agree to stand and fight and then flee at the first opportunity, if a harsh Kindred demanded it.</p>","type":"wod.types.disciplinepower","level":"1","value":0,"max":5,"dice1":"manipulation","dice2":"animalken","bonus":0,"difficulty":"-1","isrollable":true,"isactive":false,"spendwillpower":false,"spendrage":false,"spendgnosis":false,"spendblood":false,"spendglamour":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_ayjvek5uc09","path":"Disciplines#/CF_SEP/Animalism","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.2.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670224311518,"modifiedTime":1675242359421,"lastModifiedBy":"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc"},"_id":"HcYpWCOUPKDgvVex","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc":3}}

Generally, the necromancer can draw anywhere from one to four points of entropy from such a location, although the difficulty in using all Necromancy and similar deathly powers within the area increases by an equal amount for a number of nights equal to the points taken.

The character is vulnerable to any attack the ghost might make, even those that do not normally affect the physical world; while feeding, the vampire is essentially in a half-state, existing in both the living lands and the Underworld simultaneously. The wraith so attacked is considered immobilized and cannot run or escape unless it can defeat the vampire in a resisted Willpower roll (difficulty 6 for both sides).

The Tremere Clan is best known for their possession (and jealous hoarding) of this Discipline. The Tremere created Thaumaturgy by combining mortal wizardry with the power of vampiric vitae, and as a result it is a versatile and powerful Discipline. Although there are whispers of the existence of Tremere antitribu in the Sabbat, other Clans in the Sword of Caine have also researched and developed access to such mystical might. Nevertheless, the Tremere of the Camarilla remain this Discipline&rsquo;s masters.<br><br>Like Necromancy, the practice of Thaumaturgy is divided into paths and rituals. Thaumaturgical paths are applications of the vampire&rsquo;s knowledge of blood magic, allowing her to create effects on a whim. Rituals are more formulaic in nature, most akin to ancient magical &ldquo;spells.&rdquo; Because so many different paths and rituals are available to the arcane Tremere, one never knows what to expect when confronted with a practitioner of this Discipline.<br><br>When a character first learns Thaumaturgy, the player selects a path for the character. That path is considered the character&rsquo;s primary path, and she automatically receives one dot in it, as well as one Level One ritual. Thereafter, whenever the character increases her level in Thaumaturgy, her rating in the primary path increases by one as well. Additional rituals are learned separately, as part of a story; players need not pay experience points for their characters to learn rituals up to the level equal to their overall rating in Thaumaturgy, though they must find someone to teach the rituals in question. Path ratings never exceed 5, though the overall Thaumaturgy score may. If a character reaches a rating of 5 in her primary path and increases her Thaumaturgy score afterward, she may allocate her &ldquo;free&rdquo; path dot to a different path. (Experience costs are covered on p. 124.)<br><br>Many Kindred fear crossing the practitioners of Thaumaturgy. It is a very potent and mutable Discipline, and almost anything the Kindred wishes may be accomplished through its magic.</p>","details":"<h2>Thaumaturgical Paths</h2>\n<p>Paths define the types of magic a vampire can perform. A vampire typically learns his primary path from his sire, though it is not unknown for some vampires to study under many different tutors.<br><br>As mentioned before, the first path a character learns is considered her primary path and increases automatically as the character advances in the Discipline itself. Secondary paths may be learned once the character has acquired two or more dots in her primary path, and they must be raised separately with experience points. Furthermore, a character&rsquo;s rating in her primary path must always be at least one dot higher than any of her secondary paths until she has mastered her primary path. Once the character has achieved the fifth level of her primary path, secondary paths may be increased to that level.<br><br>Each time the character invokes one of the powers of a Thaumaturgical path, the thaumaturge&rsquo;s player must spend a blood point and make a Willpower roll against a difficulty equal to the power&rsquo;s level +3. Only one success is required to invoke a path&rsquo;s effect &mdash; path levels, not successes, govern the power of blood magic. Failure on this roll indicates that the magic fails. A botch causes some kind of loss or catastrophic backfire, such as losing a Willpower point (or dot!), spontaneous combustion, or accidentally letting a living statue run rampant. Thaumaturgy is an unforgiving art.<br><br>Various Sects and Clans have different access to each path, but unless the Storyteller decides otherwise, it is assumed the Tremere have some access to all of them. (&ldquo;Having access&rdquo; does not mean the same thing as &ldquo;easily gained,&rdquo; especially within the Tremere power structure.) The paths start with one of the most common (The Path of Blood), and thereafter are presented in alphabetical order.

The Kindred with this power can discern the most well-hidden psychoses, or gain insight into a person&rsquo;s true self.

Discerning the Nature of a stranger would be difficulty 9, a casual acquaintance would be an 8, and an established ally a 6. The vampire could also read the message locked in a coded missive (difficulty 7), or even see the doings of an invisible hand in such events as the pattern of falling leaves (difficulty 6). Almost anything might contain some hidden insight, no matter how trivial or meaningless. The patterns are present in most things, but are often so intricate they can keep a vampire spellbound for hours while she tries to understand their message.<br><br>This is a potent power, subject to adjudication.

Conditioning is an extended action, for which the Storyteller secretly determines the number of successes required.

The subject does exactly as she is told (including taking actions that would injure herself), as long as her master can communicate with her verbally.

The subject must be separated entirely from the vampire to whom she was in thrall. This period of separation varies depending on the individual, but the Storyteller may set it at six months, less a number of weeks equal to the subject&rsquo;s permanent Willpower rating (so a person with 5 Willpower must stay away from the vampire for just under five months). The subject regains her personality slowly during this time, though she may still lapse into brief spells of listlessness, despair, or even anger. If the vampire encounters the target before that time passes, a single successful Charisma + Leadership roll (difficulty of the target&rsquo;s current Willpower points) on the part of the vampire completely reasserts the dominance.<br><br>If the subject makes it through the time period without intervention by her master, the target regains her former individuality. Even so, the vampire may reestablish conditioning more easily than the first time, since the subject is now predisposed to falling under the Kindred&rsquo;s mental control.

Over time, though, a necromancer can become sensitized to the pull that occurs when a soul escapes from a body only to hover in wait, enslaved by its desires.

More importantly, if the target loses all of his temporary Willpower by Baal&rsquo;s Caress, he temporarily becomes fully blood-bonded to the vizier.

An Obfuscated vampire doesn&rsquo;t actually become invisible, however &mdash; rather, he is able to delude observers into believing that he has vanished. Obfuscate also allows Kindred to change their features and conceal other people or objects. Typically vampires using Obfuscate must be within a short range of their witnesses (approximately five yards or meters per dot of Wits + Stealth) for their power to be effective.<br><br>Unless the Kindred chooses to make herself seen, she can remain obscured for as long as she wills it. At higher levels, the vampire can actually fade from sight so subtly that those nearby can&rsquo;t actually recall the moment at which she left.<br><br>Usually, few mortals or supernaturals (even those trained in Awareness) can pierce through the fog of Obfuscate. Animals, who rely more on their instincts than their normal senses, can sometime perceive (and be frightened by) the vampire&rsquo;s presence. Children and those to whom deception is foreign may also be able to pierce the illusion, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. Finally, the Auspex Discipline enables Kindred to see through Obfuscate. Even that is not guaranteed, however; refer to &ldquo;Seeing the Unseen,&rdquo; p. 142, for more details. (Storytellers needing a die roll for animals or children can use this quick and dirty guideline: treat them as if they had Auspex 1 in terms of contesting Obfuscate. They do not have the Auspex 1 power, but are considered to have it when determining whether a vampire is noticed.)<br><br>Since Obfuscate clouds the mind of the viewer, vampires can&rsquo;t use it to hide their presence from electronic or mechanical devices. Video and photo cameras, for example, capture the vampire&rsquo;s image accurately. Even so, the person using, say, her cell phone to record an Obfuscated vampire will still have her mind impacted by the power, and she won&rsquo;t see the Kindred&rsquo;s image until she views the video at a later date (if even then).<br><br>Several Clans cultivate this power &mdash; the Assamites, Followers of Set, and Malkavians, for example &mdash; but the Nosferatu are particularly known for this Discipline.

This is a relatively recent invention, developed by a nomadic pair of Toreador antitribu at the tail end of the twentieth century. In the nights leading up to a war party, packs get inked and pierced, covered in symbolic body modifications invoking Awe, Dread Gaze, or even Majesty. Raucous parties tend to coalesce around the ritual, as each member gets marked, and the pack gets more and more hyped and psyched up for the raid. The artist must invest her own blood into the process, whether that&rsquo;s by bathing her tools in it or mixing it into her inks, so it&rsquo;s considered good form for the pack to provide sources of blood for the artist during the revel, since she is investing so much for their cause. The modifications themselves are often elaborate and are themselves sources of pride for the packs and artists alike.

Since they have no physical bodies, astral characters seeking to interact &ldquo;physically&rdquo; substitute Mental and Social Traits for Physical ones (Wits replaces Dexterity, Manipulation supplants Strength, and Intelligence replaces Stamina). Due to the lack of a material form, the only real way to damage another psychic entity is to cut its silver cord. When fighting this way, consider Willpower points to be health levels; when a combatant loses all of her Willpower, the cord is severed.<br><br>Although an astrally projected character remains in the reflection of the mortal world, she may venture further into the spirit realms, especially if she becomes lost. Other beings with particular sensitivity to psychic activity, such as ghosts, werewolves, and even some magi, travel the astral plane as well, and can interact with a vampire&rsquo;s psychic presence normally (although the astrally projected character is not considered a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; for powers such as Necromancy). The observing character notices the astrally projecting vampire with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 8), requiring more successes than the Psychic Projection activation roll. Even those who do notice you won&rsquo;t be able to identify you; you are merely an immaterial shade hovering in the general area. Storytellers are encouraged to make trips into the spirit world as bizarre, mysterious, and dreamlike as possible. The world beyond is a vivid and fantastic place, where the true nature of things is stronger and often strikingly different from their earthly appearances.</p>","type":"wod.types.disciplinepower","level":"5","value":0,"max":5,"dice1":"perception","dice2":"awareness","bonus":0,"difficulty":"-1","isrollable":true,"isactive":false,"spendwillpower":false,"spendrage":false,"spendgnosis":false,"spendblood":false,"spendglamour":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_mci6uomhfio","path":"Disciplines#/CF_SEP/Auspex","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.2.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668764159874,"modifiedTime":1675242360836,"lastModifiedBy":"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc"},"_id":"mnjVrWwmsnINEPDd","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc":3}}

The only Kindred who are immune to this internal attack are those who have had their hearts removed by Serpentis.</p>","details":"<p>The ritual takes five hours to enact, minus 30 minutes per success.

When the ritual is complete, the stake is enchanted to act as described above.<br><br>An attack with a Shaft of Belated Quiescence is performed as with a normal stake: a Dexterity + Melee roll (difficulty 6, modified as per the normal combat rules; the attack does not need to specifically target the heart) with a lethal damage rating of Strength + 1.

If not, the stake may be used to make subsequent attacks until it strikes deep enough to activate.<br><br>Once the tip of the stake is in the victim&rsquo;s body, the Storyteller begins an extended roll of the caster&rsquo;s Thaumaturgy rating (difficulty 9), rolling once per hour of game time. Successes on this roll are added to the successes scored in the initial attack. This represents the tip&rsquo;s progress toward the victim&rsquo;s heart. A botch indicates that the tip has struck a bone and all accumulated successes are lost (including those from the initial attack roll). Removing the part of the body where the tip impacted (such as a Tzimisce turning into blood or a vampire cutting off their arm) may stop the tip&rsquo;s progress, depending on the number of successes acquired and the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. When the shaft accumulates a total of 15 successes, it reaches the victim&rsquo;s heart. This paralyzes Kindred and is instantly fatal to mortals and ghouls.<br><br>Attempts to surgically remove the tip of the shaft can be made with an extended Dexterity + Medicine roll made once per hour (difficulty 7 for Kindred and 8 for mortals). The surgeon must accumulate a number of successes equal to those currently held by the shaft in order to remove the tip. Once surgery begins, however, the shaft begins actively evading the surgeon&rsquo;s probes, and its rolls are made once every 30 minutes for the duration of the surgery attempt. Each individual surgery roll that scores less than three successes inflicts an additional unsoakable level of lethal damage on the patient.<br><br>Shaft of Belated Quiescence may be performed on other wooden impaling weapons, such as spears, arrows, practice swords, and pool cues, provided that they are made of rowan wood.

When imbibed by the necromancer, this mixture causes him to sweat a glistening sheen of blood (equal to one blood point). The Kindred then dons the skin of his victim, which on a successful roll absorbs the Kindred vitae and begins to heal, forming a second skin over the vampire&rsquo;s own.

If it takes longer than one turn to spend the necessary blood to enact this ability, it does not take effect until all 12 points have been spent.

She retains a few of her vampiric benefits, however. Fortitude and Auspex abilities remain in place if she has either of those Disciplines, and the Storyteller may allow her to retain other Disciplines as well if he deems them dramatically appropriate. She also retains a vampire&rsquo;s benefits when it comes to handling bashing damage. However, she is still vulnerable to holy artifacts, human faith, and being staked.

Strafing adds 10 dice to accuracy on a standard attack roll, and empties the clip. A maximum of three yards/meters can be covered with this maneuver.\n\nThe attacker divides any successes gained on the attack roll evenly among all targets in the covered area (successes assigned to hit an individual are added to that target’s damage dice pool, as well). If only one target is within range or the area of effect, only half the successes affect him. The attacker then assigns any leftover successes as she desires. If fewer successes are rolled than there are targets, only one may be assigned per target until they are all allocated.\n\nDodge rolls against strafing are at +1 difficulty","details":"","isequipped":false,"ismagical":false,"isweapon":false,"attack":{"attribute":"dexterity","ability":"firearms","secondaryabilityid":"","accuracy":10,"isrollable":true},"damage":{"attribute":"","bonus":4,"type":"lethal","isrollable":true},"difficulty":"8","conceal":"J","istwohanded":false,"range":20,"rate":3,"mode":{"hasreload":false,"hasburst":false,"hasfullauto":false,"hasspray":true},"clip":{"value":0,"max":17}},"effects":[],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_mnc9kopzels","path":"Items#/CF_SEP/Ranged Weapons","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.2.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674287371409,"modifiedTime":1675241567225,"lastModifiedBy":"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc"},"_id":"zzhJgI4sC8vcH8s6","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc":3}}
