Because there are so many ways to expend, regain, and use Willpower, it fluctuates more than any other Trait (besides blood pool) in the game. Willpower is a very versatile Trait, so make sure you understand how to use it.<br /></p><ul><li><p>A player may spend one of her character’s Willpower points to gain an automatic success on a single action. Only one point of Willpower may be used in a single turn in this manner, but the success is guaranteed and may not be canceled, even by botches. By using Willpower in this way, it is possible to succeed at a given action simply by concentrating. For extended rolls, these extra successes may make the critical difference between accomplishment and failure.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> You must declare that you are spending a Willpower point before you make an actual roll for a character’s action; you can’t retroactively cancel a botch by spending a Willpower point at the last minute. Also, the Storyteller may declare that a Willpower point may not be spent on a given action (such as attacking in combat).<br /></p></li><li><p>Sometimes, the Storyteller may rule that a character automatically takes some action based on instinct or urge — for example, stepping back from a chasm or leaping away from a patch of sunlight filtering through a window. The Storyteller may allow a player to spend a Willpower point and avoid taking this reactive maneuver. It should be noted that the impulse may return at the Storyteller’s discretion; a player may need to spend multiple Willpower points over the course of a few turns to stay on task. Sometimes the urge may be overcome by the force of the character’s will; at other times, the character has no choice but to follow his instinct (i.e., the character runs out of Willpower points or no longer wishes to expend them).<br /></p></li><li><p>A Willpower point may be spent to prevent a derangement from manifesting, with the Storyteller’s permission. Eventually, if enough Willpower points are spent (as determined by the Storyteller), the derangement may be overcome and eliminated, as enough denial of the derangement remedies the aberration. Malkavians may never overcome their initial derangement, though Willpower may be spent to deny it for a short period of time.<br /></p></li><li><p>By spending a Willpower point, wound penalties can be ignored for one turn. This allows a character to override pain and injury in order to take one last-ditch action. However, an incapacitated or torpored character may not spend Willpower in this manner.</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>Regaining Willpower</h2><p><br />Willpower may be recovered as well as spent. The following situations earn the character back a point or more of Willpower, though a character’s Willpower pool may never exceed her Willpower rating. The only way to increase a character’s Willpower rating is through experience-point expenditure.<br /><br />Generally, a character’s Willpower pool may be replenished whenever the character fulfills a goal or has an opportunity to restore her self-confidence. Ultimately, specific instances of Willpower restoration are up to the Storyteller. For this reason, Storytellers are advised to be prudent in allowing characters to regain Willpower; it is a powerful and versatile Trait, and permitting players to rely on it too much strips much of the challenge from a story.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Characters’ Willpower pools replenish fully at the end of a given story (and that’s story, not session). The Storyteller may restrict this by requiring that the characters achieve (or partially achieve) a goal or otherwise boost their self-esteem. For example, if the characters didn’t destroy a powerful and corrupt elder but did manage to obstruct his immediate plans, allow them to replenish their Willpower pools.<br /></p></li><li><p>(Storyteller’s Option) Characters regain one Willpower point each night when they first rise. This is easy on the bookkeeping, and allows a steady stream of Willpower replenishment (not to mention the fact that players are already writing on that part of the character sheet when they mark off their nightly blood consumption).<br /></p></li><li><p>(Storyteller’s Option) If a character attains some extraordinary goal or fulfills an outstanding objective, the Storyteller may reward her with a point of Willpower. For example, if a character manages to deter a team of vampire-hunters from her sire’s haven, the Storyteller may award a Willpower point to that character.<br /></p></li><li><p>(Storyteller’s Option) If a character behaves in a manner that fulfills her Nature Archetype, the Storyteller may reward the character with one to three Willpower points (as stated in the Archetype descriptions). For example, if a Rebel character rabidly opposes a powerful elder, and that elder is later revealed to be a Sabbat spy, that character may be given a point of Willpower.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Storytellers are encouraged to create their own systems or modify our systems to suit their troupe’s style of play. Indeed, the manner in which a Storyteller allows, or refuses to allow, Willpower replenishment can determine the overall mood of the chronicle.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"journal-backlinks":{"references":[]}},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"sort":1400000,"name":"Combat Maneuvers","type":"text","_id":"EoyznoKiTUAFvYpz","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h4><strong>Maneuver Characteristics</strong><br />[Sidebar: V20 pg. 275]</h4><p>Maneuvers are typically performed versus difficulty 6.

A “+3” adds three dice to the dice pool for that attack.</p><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Any additions or subtractions to an attack’s difficulty (which is most often 6). A “+2” means the difficulty of an attack, if initially 6, is increased to 8.</p><p><strong>Damage:</strong> The damage dice pool used.</p><p></p><h2>General Maneuvers</h2><p>[V20 pg. 274]</p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Aborting Actions:<br /></strong>You can abandon your character’s declared action in favor of a defensive action as long as your character hasn’t acted in the turn. Actions that can take the place of a previously declared action include block, dodge, and parry. A successful Willpower roll versus difficulty 6 (or the expenditure of a Willpower point) is required for a character to abort an action and perform a defensive one instead. When spending Willpower for an abort maneuver, a character may declare the Willpower expenditure at the time of the abort. A Willpower roll to abort is considered a reflexive action. (See “Defensive Maneuvers,” below, for descriptions of block, dodge, and parry.)<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Ambush:<br /></strong>Ambushes involve surprising a target to get in a decisive first strike. The attacker rolls Dexterity + Stealth in a resisted action against the target’s Perception + Alertness. If the attacker scores more successes, she can stage one free attack on the target; she then adds any extra successes from the resisted roll to her attack dice pool. On a tie, the attacker still attacks first, although the target may perform a defensive maneuver. If the defender gets more successes, he spots the ambush, and both parties determine initiative normally. Targets already involved in combat cannot be ambushed.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Blind Fighting/Fire:</strong><br />Staging attacks while blind (or in pitch darkness) usually incurs a +2 difficulty, and ranged attacks cannot be accurately made at all. Powers such as Heightened Senses (p. 134) and Eyes of the Beast (p. 199) mitigate this penalty.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Flank and Rear Attacks:</strong><br />Characters attacking targets from the flank gain an additional attack die. Characters attacking from the rear gain two additional attack dice.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Movement:</strong><br />A character may move half of her running distance (see “Movement,” p. 258) and still take an action in a turn. Other maneuvers such as leaping or tumbling may be considered separate actions, depending on their complexity.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple Actions:</strong><br />If you declare multiple actions, declare the total number of actions you wish to attempt and determine which of the dice pools is the smallest. Then, divide that number of dice between all of your actions. If a character performs only defensive actions in a turn, use the appropriate block, dodge, or parry system. See Chapter Five, p. 248 for more information.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Targeting:</strong><br />Aiming for a specific location incurs an added difficulty, but can bypass armor or cover, or can result in an increased damage effect. The Storyteller should consider special results beyond a simple increase in damage, depending on the attack and the target.<br />  </p><table style=\"width:100.036%;height:134.4px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:16.8px\"><td style=\"width:62.0917%;height:16.8px\"><strong>Target Size</strong></td><td style=\"width:20.7579%;height:16.8px\"><strong>Difficulty</strong></td><td style=\"width:17.2983%;height:16.8px\"><strong>Damage</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:16.8px\"><td style=\"width:62.0917%;height:16.8px\">Medium (limb, briefcase)</td><td style=\"width:20.7579%;height:16.8px\">+1</td><td style=\"width:17.2983%;height:16.8px\">No Modifier</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16.8px\"><td style=\"width:62.0917%;height:16.8px\">Small (hand, head, cellphone)</td><td style=\"width:20.7579%;height:16.8px\">+2</td><td style=\"width:17.2983%;height:16.8px\">+1</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16.8px\"><td style=\"width:62.0917%;height:16.8px\">Precise (eye, heart, lock)</td><td style=\"width:20.7579%;height:16.8px\">+3</td><td style=\"width:17.2983%;height:16.8px\">+2</td></tr></tbody></table><p> <br /></p></li></ul><h2>Defensive Maneuvers</h2><p>[V20 pg. 274]<br /><br />It’s a given that your character tries to avoid being hit in combat — that’s why everyone makes attack rolls to try to hit you. Sometimes, though, all your character wants to do is avoid attacks. You may announce a defensive action at any time before your character’s opponent makes an attack roll, as long as your character has an action left to perform. You can declare a defensive action on your character’s turn in the initiative, or can even abort to a defensive maneuver. You must make a successful Willpower roll (or may simply spend one point of Willpower) to abort. If the Willpower roll fails, your character must carry out the action that you declared originally.<br /><br />There are three types of defensive actions: block, dodge, and parry. Your character can defend against virtually any kind of attack with these three maneuvers. However, your character may not be able to avoid every single attack that’s directed at her. She can’t dodge when there’s no room to maneuver, and she can’t block or parry if she doesn’t know an attack is coming.<br /><br />Each defensive maneuver uses the same basic system: The defensive action is a resisted roll against the opponent’s attack roll. Unless the attacker gets more total successes, he misses. If the attacker gets more successes, those that he achieves in excess of the defender’s successes, if any, are used to hit (the attacker doesn’t necessarily use all the successes he rolled). So if the defender has fewer successes than the attacker does, the defender’s maneuver can still reduce the effectiveness of the attack, even if the maneuver can’t counteract it completely.<br /></p><ul><li><p><strong>Block:</strong><br />A Dexterity + Brawl maneuver using your character’s own body to deflect a hand-to-hand bashing attack. Lethal and aggravated attacks cannot be blocked unless the defender has Fortitude or is wearing armor.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Dodge:</strong><br />A Dexterity + Athletics maneuver useful for avoiding attacks of all types. Your character bobs and weaves to avoid Melee or Brawl attacks (if there’s no room to maneuver, she must block or parry instead). In gunfights, your character moves at least one yard/meter and ends up behind cover (if there’s no room to maneuver or no cover available, she can drop to the ground). If your character remains under cover or prone, cover rules apply against further Firearms attacks (see “Cover,” p. 278).<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Parry:</strong><br />A Dexterity + Melee maneuver using a weapon to block a Brawl or Melee attack. If a character makes a Brawl attack and the defender parries with a weapon that normally causes lethal damage, the attacker can actually be hurt by a successful parry. If the defender rolls more successes than the attacker does in the resisted action, the defender rolls the weapon’s base damage plus the parry’s extra successes as a damage dice pool against the attacker.<br /></p></li></ul><p>Block, dodge, and parry can be performed as part of a multiple action in your character’s turn (punching then blocking, shooting then dodging, parrying then striking). Using a multiple action to act and defend is advantageous because your character can still accomplish something in a turn besides avoiding attacks.<br /></p><p>Rather than having to divide your dice pool among multiple defensive actions, you may declare that your character spends an entire turn defending. The normal multiple-action rules are not used in this case. Instead, you have a full dice pool for the first defensive action, but lose one die, cumulatively, for each subsequent defense action made in the same turn. It is still difficult to avoid several incoming attacks, but not as difficult as trying to attempt multiple things at once.<br /></p><p>Remember that any actions, including defensive ones, versus multiple attackers still suffer difficulty penalties (see “Multiple Opponents,” p. 276).</p><p></p><h2>Close-Combat Maneuvers</h2><img src=\"worlds/atlanta-by-night/Images/Other/Close%20Combat%20Maneuvers%20Table.png\" alt=\"[Close Combat Maneuvers Table: V20 279]\" /><p><br />[V20 pg. 275]<br /><br />This is simply a listing of the common maneuvers used in close combat; feel free to develop your own moves (with the Storyteller’s approval). All hand-to-hand attacks inflict bashing damage unless stated otherwise. The damage inflicted by melee attacks depends on the weapon type (see the Melee Weapons Chart, p. 280). It is typically lethal, though clubs and other blunt instruments inflict bashing damage. All references to Strength also gain the benefit of Potence, as detailed on p. 192.<br /><br />Difficulty and damage for these maneuvers may be modified at the Storyteller’s discretion, depending on the combat style the character uses. As always, drama and excitement take precedence over rules systems.</p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Bite:</strong><br />This maneuver is available only to vampires (or other supernatural creatures with sharp teeth, such as werewolves). A bite maneuver is a “combat” bite, intended to cause damage rather than drain blood. Bite damage is aggravated. To use a bite attack, the vampire must first perform a successful clinch, hold, or tackle maneuver (see below). On the turn following the successful attack, the player may declare the bite attempt and make a roll using the modifiers below.<br /><br />Alternatively, a player can declare her vampire’s bite to be a “Kiss” attack. A Kiss is resolved in the same way as a normal bite, but inflicts no health levels of damage. Upon connecting with a Kiss, the vampire may begin to drain the victim’s blood at the normal rate, and the victim is typically helpless to resist (see p. 269 for specifics). Following the Kiss, a vampire may, if she chooses, lick the puncture wound of the Kiss closed, thereby removing any evidence that she has fed.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Brawl</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>Normal</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>+1</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Strength +1</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Claw:</strong><br />This attack is available to vampires with claws, such as those from the Protean power of Feral Claws or bone spurs constructed with the Vicissitude power of Bonecraft. A few other supernatural creatures, such as werewolves, also have claws. A claw attack inflicts aggravated damage (if Feral Claws) or lethal damage (if a Vicissitude-constructed weapon).</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Brawl</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>Normal</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>Normal</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Strength +1</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Clinch:</strong><br />On a successful attack roll, the attacker goes into a clinch with the target. In the first turn, the attacker may roll Strength damage. In each subsequent turn, combatants act on their orders in the initiative. A combatant can inflict Strength damage automatically or attempt to escape the clinch. No other actions are allowed until one combatant breaks free. To escape a clinch, make a resisted Strength + Brawl roll against the opponent. If the escaping character has more successes, she breaks free; if not, the characters continue to grapple in the next turn.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Strength + Brawl</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>Normal</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>Normal</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Strength</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Disarm:</strong><br />To strike an opponent’s weapon, the attacker must make an attack roll at +1 difficulty. If successful, the attacker rolls damage normally. If successes rolled exceed the opponent’s Strength rating, the opponent takes no damage but is disarmed. A botch usually means the attacker drops her own weapon or is struck by her target’s weapon.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Melee</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>+1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>Normal</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Special</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Hold:</strong><br />This attack inflicts no damage, as the intent is to immobilize rather than injure the subject. On a successful roll, the attacker holds the target until the subject’s next action.

The base attack is a standard action and inflicts the character’s Strength in damage.

The target takes Strength damage and must roll Dexterity + Athletics (difficulty 8) or suffer a knockdown (see “Maneuver Complications,” p. 279).<br /><br />The attacker can also use a staff, chain, or similar implement to perform a sweep. The effect is the same, although the target takes damage per the weapon type.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Brawl/Melee</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>+1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>Normal</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Strength; Knockdown</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Tackle:</strong><br />The attacker rushes her opponent, tackling him to the ground. The attack roll is at +1 difficulty, and the maneuver inflicts Strength +1 damage. Additionally, both combatants must roll Dexterity + Athletics (difficulty 7) or suffer a knockdown (see “Maneuver Complications,” p. 279). Even if the target’s Athletics roll succeeds, he is unbalanced, suffering +1 difficulty to his actions for the next turn.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Brawl</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>+1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>Normal</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Strength +1</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Weapon Length:</strong><br />It is difficult to get in range with a punch or knife if someone else is wielding a sword or staff. A character being fended off with a longer weapon must close in one yard/meter before striking, losing a die from her attack roll in the process.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Weapon Strike:</strong><br />A slashing blow, thrust, or jab, depending on the weapon used.

The following maneuvers allow for a number of useful actions during a firefight. Don’t feel limited by this list; if the need arises, try developing a new maneuver (at the Storyteller’s discretion). Refer to the Ranged Weapons Chart, p. 281, for specific information.<br /></p><ul><li><p><strong>Aiming:</strong><br />The attacker adds one die to her attack dice pool on a single shot for each turn spent aiming. The maximum number of dice that can be added in this way is equal to the character’s Perception, and a character must have Firearms 1 or better to use this maneuver. A scope adds two more dice to the attacker’s pool in the first turn of aiming (in addition to those added for Perception). The attacker may do nothing but aim during this time. Additionally, it isn’t possible to aim at a target that is moving faster than a walk.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Automatic Fire:</strong><br />The weapon unloads its entire ammunition clip in one attack against a single target. The attacker makes a single roll, adding 10 dice to her accuracy. However, the attack roll is at a +2 difficulty due to the weapon’s recoil. Extra successes add to the damage dice pool, which is still treated as equivalent to one bullet. An attacker using automatic fire may not target a specific area of the body.<br /><br />This attack is permissible only if the weapon’s clip is at least half-full to begin with.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Firearms</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>+2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>+10</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Special</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Cover:</strong><br />Cover increases an attacker’s difficulty to hit a target (and often the target’s ability to fire back). Difficulty penalties for hitting a target under various types of cover are listed below. A character who fires back from behind cover is also at something of a disadvantage to hit, as he exposes himself and ducks back under protection. Firearms attacks made by a defender who is under cover are at one lower difficulty than listed below. (If a listed difficulty is +1, then the defender suffers no penalty to make attacks from under that cover.) If your character hides behind a wall, attackers’ Firearms rolls have a +2 difficulty. Your character’s attacks staged from behind that wall are at +1 difficulty.<br /><br />Note that difficulties for combatants who are both under cover are cumulative. If one combatant is prone and one is behind a wall, attacks staged by the prone character are at +2 difficulty, while attacks staged by the character behind the wall are also at +2 difficulty.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cover Type</strong></td><td><strong>Difficulty Increase</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Light (lying prone)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Good (behind wall)</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Superior (only head exposed)</td><td>+3</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple Shots:</strong><br />An attacker with a fast firearm may try to take more than one shot in a turn. The attacker can divide his attack dice pool by how many shots she wants to fire at a similar number of targets, up to the weapon’s rate of fire (multiple attacks against the same target are covered under maneuvers like “Automatic Fire” and “Three-Round Burst”). Each attack is then rolled separately.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Firearms</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>Normal</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>Special</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Weapon</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Range:</strong><br />The Ranged Weapons Chart (p. 281) lists each weapon’s short range; attacks made at that range are versus difficulty 6. Twice that listing is the weapon’s maximum range. Attacks made up to maximum range are versus difficulty 8. Attacks made at targets within two meters are considered <em>point blank</em>. Pointblank shots are made versus difficulty 4.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Reloading:</strong><br />Reloading takes one full turn and requires the character’s concentration. Like any other maneuver, reloading can be performed as part of a multiple action.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Strafing:</strong><br />Instead of aiming at one target, fully-automatic weapons can be fired across an area. Strafing adds 10 dice to accuracy on a standard attack roll, and empties the clip. A maximum of three yards/meters can be covered with this maneuver.<br /><br />The attacker divides any successes gained on the attack roll evenly among all targets in the covered area (successes assigned to hit an individual are added to that target’s damage dice pool, as well). If only one target is within range or the area of effect, only half the successes affect him. The attacker then assigns any leftover successes as she desires. If fewer successes are rolled than there are targets, only one may be assigned per target until they are all allocated.<br /><br />Dodge rolls against strafing are at +1 difficulty</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Firearms</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>+2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>+10</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Special</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Three-Round Burst:</strong><br />The attacker gains two additional dice on a single attack roll, and expends three shots from the weapon’s clip. Only certain weapons may perform this maneuver; see the Ranged Weapons Chart for particulars. Attacks are made at +1 difficulty due to recoil. As with automatic fire, the damage dice pool is based on one bullet from the weapon in question.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Traits: </strong>Dexterity + Firearms</td><td><strong>Difficulty: </strong>+1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accuracy: </strong>+2</td><td><strong>Damage: </strong>Weapon</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Two Weapons:</strong><br />Firing two weapons is considered performing a multiple action, complete with dividing the dice of the lowest pool between two different targets.

The Storyteller should add any others as the situation warrants.<br /><br /></p><ul><li><p><strong>Blinded:</strong><br />Add two dice to attack rolls made against a blinded target. Furthermore, blind characters are at +2 difficulty on all actions.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Dazed:</strong><br />If, in a single attack, the attacker rolls a number of damage successes greater than the target’s Stamina (for mortals) or Stamina + 2 (for vampires and other supernatural beings), the victim is dazed. The target must spend her next available turn shaking off the attack’s effects. Only damage successes that penetrate the defender’s soak attempt count toward this total.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Immobilization:</strong><br />Add two dice to attack rolls made on an immobilized (i.e., held by someone or something) but still struggling target. Attacks hit automatically if the target is completely immobilized (tied up, staked, or otherwise paralyzed).<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Knockdown:</strong><br />The victim falls down. After suffering a knockdown, the subject makes a Dexterity + Athletics roll. If successful, she may get back on herfeet immediately, but her initiative is reduced by two in the next turn. On a failed roll, the subject spends her next action climbing to her feet, if she chooses to rise. On a botch, she lands particularly hard or at a severe angle, taking an automatic health level of bashing damage.<br /><br />Maneuvers like tackle and sweep are intended to knock an opponent down. However, an especially powerful attack of any kind may send the target to the ground. Such instances are best left to the Storyteller’s discretion, and should occur only when appropriately cinematic or suitable to the story.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Stake Through Heart:</strong><br />A vampire can indeed be incapacitated by the classic wooden stake of legend. However, the legends err on one point: A Kindred impaled through the heart with a wooden stake is not destroyed, but merely paralyzed until the stake is removed.<br /><br />To stake a vampire, an attacker must target the heart (difficulty 9). If the attack succeeds and inflicts at least three health levels of damage, the target is immobilized. An immobilized victim is conscious (and may use perception powers, such as those in the Auspex Discipline), but may not move or spend blood points.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"journal-backlinks":{"references":[]}},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"sort":1500000,"name":"Damage and Healing","type":"text","_id":"oncrjFt4kfs9OeHv","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Applying Damage</h2><p>[V20 pg. 285]<br /><br />Bashing and lethal damage differ in their effects, but for vampires, both types of damage are considered <em>normal</em>.

Aggravated damage always gets marked above lethal, which gets marked above bashing. So if you mark a level of lethal damage in the Bruised box, and take one aggravated health level later on, “move down” the lethal level to the Hurt box by marking that box with a “X.” The aggravated level is then noted by simply drawing another line through the Bruised box, turning it into “*.” Bashing and lethal levels taken after aggravated levels are simply drawn in on the next open box. Normal damage isn’t as severe as aggravated, so it’s always marked last and healed first (see below).</p><p></p><h2>Bashing Damage</h2><p>[V20 pg. 285]<br /><br />[…] while vampires may also soak bashing damage with their Stamina (+ Fortitude, if they have that Discipline).

Following this act, the vampire must continue to suck, for (according to Kindred legend) the very soul is withdrawn from the victim’s body and taken into the diablerist’s. The effort involved in diablerie is monumental, for the vampiric soul is a greedy thing and clings tenaciously to unlife, hoping to regenerate its body and rise once again.<br /><br />Once a vampire’s body has been drained of all blood, the true struggle begins. The diablerist’s player makes an extended Strength roll (difficulty 9). Each success inflicts one automatic health level on the victim (the victim cannot soak, and damage is considered aggravated). When all the victim’s health levels have been drained, the victim’s essence is taken into the attacker and the emptied body begins decaying immediately. <br /><br />A vampire committing diablerie is quite vulnerable to attack. Total concentration goes into the struggle to draw forth the essence of the victim, and stopping for even a moment ruins the chance of capturing the spirit. All attacks against a vampire attempting diablerie are made versus a difficulty of 2.</p></blockquote><p><br />the roll to avoid losing control to euphoria (found under “The Rewards of Diablerie” on p. 294 of V20)<br /></p><blockquote><p>Upon successful completion of diablerie, the diablerist is overwhelmed by euphoria, and a Self-Control/Instincts roll is necessary (difficulty 10 minus the character’s Humanity or Path rating) to avoid losing control.</p></blockquote><p><br />instead determines whether or not the diablerist becomes permanently addicted to diablerie. If the roll is a failure, make the notation “Addicted to Diablerie” under Flaws on the character sheet. A character addicted to diablerie will indulge in drinking vampiric blood whenever possible. When she is given the opportunity to consume vampiric blood, the player must roll Self-Control or Instinct (difficulty 6). If this roll fails, the character frenzies, attacks the target, and drinks as much blood as she can. <br /><br />Regardless of success or failure on the addiction roll, the diablerist is lost in euphoria and numb to the external world for the remainder of the scene, ignoring wounds (though still sustaining damage), and any attempt to engage their attention fails until all of the following challenges have been met. Each challenge takes one turn to complete.</p><p></p><h2>Step 2: Generation</h2><p>If the victim is of a lower Generation than the diablerist, the diablerist automatically lowers her Generation by one. Additionally, if the victim was two or more Generations lower than the diablerist, the diablerist rolls Stamina once per turn for each additional Generation after the first, until they fail a challenge or run out of rolls (difficulty 9). Each success lowers the diablerist’s Generation by one and permanently grants them all benefits attributed to the Generation achieved.<br /></p><h2>Step 3: Disciplines</h2><p>Next, compare the Disciplines of both vampires, ignoring blood sorcery powers (such as Thaumaturgy, Necromancy, Koldunism, and the line), the Disciplines they have in common with each other, and levels that exceed the diablerist’s newly-acquired Generational maximums. The diablerist gains half the total amount (rounded down) of Discipline dots, after the above deductions.<br /></p><blockquote><p>For example, if an eighth generation vampire with Celerity •••, Fortitude •••••, Potence ••••, and Thaumaturgy ••• commits diablerie against a sixth generation vampire with Celerity •••••, Fortitude •••, Potence •••••, and Thaumaturgy ••••• ••, the difference is three dot. Two come from Celerity, and one comes from Potence. The diablerist’s Fortitude is higher, and Thaumaturgy does not count, as it’s a sorcery power. Half that, rounding down, is one. The diablerist gains one Discipline dot.</p></blockquote><p><br />The diablerist may purchase levels in any Disciplines possessed by the victim (though not blood sorcery powers) up to the maximum level the victim achieved in a Discipline, within the newly acquired Generational limits of the diablerist. If the diablerist acquires levels in an out-of-Clan Discipline, any future levels after diablerie are still purchased as out-of-Clan.</p><p></p><h2>Step 4: Possession</h2><p>The victim and diablerist now perform contested Willpower rolls against each other. The difficulty for each roll is equal to the permanent Willpower rating of the opponent. Each Generation the diablerist achieves adds +1 to the difficulty level of her rolls (maximum of 9), and lowers the difficulty level of rolls for the victim by 1 (minimum of 4). The first to achieve a total amount of successes equaling their opponent’s unadulterated, permanent Willpower rating wins. Botched rolls count as successes for the opponent.<br /><br />Regardless of success or failure, diablerists gain a tainted aura marking them of their crime (see “The Perils of Diablerie,” V20, pp. 294- 295).</p><blockquote><p>The black veins in auras. It's a huge section. I'm not pasting it here.</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, the diablerist deducts an amount of temporary Willpower from their sheet equal to the permanent Willpower rating of the victim. This deduction cannot put them below 1 point of temporary Willpower.<br /><br />Should the diablerist win, no further rolls are necessary, and they exit the blinding euphoria imposed upon them. Diablerists on Paths of Enlightenment that do not normally condone diablerie must make a test for moral degradation (difficulty at Storyteller’s discretion) if the act cannot be justified by the circumstances and motivation behind it.<br /><br />If the victim wins, she possesses the diablerist’s body. The severity of possession depends upon the number of dots in Generation the diablerist gains. With three or more Generations, the character has the option to acquire the Dark Secret Flaw (V20, p. 489) in order to retain the Social Merits and Flaws, as well as Backgrounds of the diablerist, while abandoning his own (even if exceeding maximum amounts for Merits and Flaws). Should the ruse be revealed, depending on who becomes aware and whether or not they care, the character regains the Social Merits and Flaws, as well as Backgrounds (save for Generation) of the victim, and loses those of the diablerist (save for Generation). If Scholar of Enemies or Scholar of Others (V20, p. 489) are possessed by the victim, they are held regardless of the choice.<br /><br /><strong>One Generation</strong><br />If the diablerist drops one Generation, the diablerist’s Nature and Supernatural Merits and Flaws are exchanged for those of the victim (and may exceed maximum point costs for Merits and Flaws). The diablerist acquires one new permanent derangement.<br /><br /><strong>Two Generations</strong><br />If the diablerist lowers his Generation by two, he suffers the same effects as gaining one dot in Generation, and additionally, half the character’s memories are replaced with the victim’s. The diablerist’s newly acquired permanent derangement is Multiple Personalities (V20, p. 292), and his secondary personality is that of the victim. On the character sheet, record the victim’s Demeanor, Mental Merits and Flaws, permanent Willpower rating, Morality Path, Virtues (and ratings), blood sorcery powers and Rituals, and mark a slash beside all Abilities, Charisma, Manipulation, and all Mental Attributes possessed by the diablerist. To the right of the slash mark, record the amount possessed by the victim in that Attribute or Ability (including Abilities not possessed by the diablerist), deducting amounts to levels proportionate to the newly acquired Generational maximums of the diablerist. When the secondary personality is triggered, all newly recorded notations change to those of the victim and become accessible to the character. The Storyteller then takes control of the character, while the primary personality blacks out and remembers nothing for the time that the secondary personality is in charge of the body.<br /><br /><strong>Three Generations</strong><br />If the diablerist lowers his Generation by three, he suffers all of the effects listed above. Additionally, the diablerist gains total and complete amnesia up until just exiting the euphoric state that accompanies diablerie. Add the Amnesia Flaw to the character’s sheet (V20, p. 486). The diablerist retains all information and experience, though he cannot recall how he knows what he knows. Their Demeanor switches to one assigned by the Storyteller. The character’s Path of Enlightenment reverts to Humanity (if on an alternate Path), and his Virtue scores and permanent Willpower reset. He receives one free dot in each Virtue and may spend 7 points amongst his Virtues as he sees fit. His Humanity rating equals his newly acquired Conscience + Self-Control Virtues, and his permanent Willpower is equal to his Courage Virtue.<br /><br /><strong>Four Generations</strong><br />If the diablerist lowers her Generation by four, the victim wholly consumes the diablerist’s soul. The victim retains none of the diablerist’s memories and continues play as the hybrid character. On the diablerist’s sheet, all Abilities, and the point totals for Charisma, Manipulation, and all Mental Attributes change to those of the victim, up to the newly acquired Generational maximum of the diablerist. Permanent Willpower rating, Nature, Demeanor, and derangements change to those of the victim. The entire victim’s previously acquired blood sorcery powers and rituals are transferred to the diablerist. Path of Enlightenment and Virtues changes to that of the victim at the victim’s full rating. Mental and Supernatural Merits and Flaws possessed by the diablerist are changed to those of the victim (and may exceed maximum amounts for Merits and Flaws).<br /><br /><strong>Five+ Generations</strong><br />If the diablerist lowers her Generation by five or more, the victim wholly consumes the diablerist’s soul. The victim retains all of the diablerist’s memories and continues play as the hybrid character. On the diablerist’s sheet, Nature and Demeanor change to those of the victim. The point value totals for Charisma, Manipulation, all Abilities, permanent Willpower rating, and all Mental Attributes take on the higher point value between the diablerist or the victim, up to the newly acquired Generational maximum of the diablerist. The entire victim’s previously acquired blood sorcery powers and rituals are transferred to the diablerist. Path of Enlightenment and Virtues changes to that of the victim at the victim’s full rating. For overlapping Virtues, take the higher score of the victim or diablerist. Derangements, as well as Mental and Supernatural Merits and Flaws possessed by the victim, are added to the diablerist’s sheet (and may exceed maximum amounts for Merits and Flaws).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"journal-backlinks":{"references":[]}},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"sort":1300000,"name":"Hunting","type":"text","_id":"jovAS3p3Ym4kri7u","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Automatic Feats</h2><p>[V20 pg. 259]<br /></p><p>It is the nature of the vampire to hunt. For each hour the vampire spends searching for human prey, allow the player to make a roll against a difficulty based on the area in which the vampire hunts. The Attribute and Ability combination used should correspond to the method by which the player describes the character’s hunting technique. For example, Appearance + Subterfuge might represent a lusty tryst at a nightclub that ends in one of the lovers slaking her thirst, Stamina + Athletics would suggest a harrowing chase across a swath of city parkland, and Wits + Streetwise might be interpreted as a deadly game of cat-and-mouse.</p><p></p><table style=\"width:100%;height:119px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px\"><strong>Area</strong></td><td style=\"height:17px\"><strong>Difficulty</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px\">Slum neighborhood/The Rack</td><td style=\"height:17px\">4</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px\">Lower-income/bohemian</td><td style=\"height:17px\">5</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px\">Downtown business district</td><td style=\"height:17px\">6</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px\">Warehouse district </td><td style=\"height:17px\">6</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px\">Suburb</td><td style=\"height:17px\">7</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px\">Heavily patrolled area</td><td style=\"height:17px\">8</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br />Success on this roll indicates that the vampire has found and subdued prey, in a manner appropriate to her methods and the area.

However, Storytellers may increase hunting difficulties for particularly inhuman vampires (Nosferatu, some Gangrel, vampires with Humanity ratings of 4 or below, or who are on Paths of Enlightenment), as such monsters find it difficult to blend in with a crowd.<br /></p><p></p><h1>Hunting Scenes</h1><p>[V20 pg. 365]<br /></p><p>One of the most iconic scenes in a vampire story is when the vampire drinks blood from her victim. Just about any vampire novel, movie, or television show has a scene (or scenes) in which we witness how the vampire hunts and feeds. And yet, it’s not always an easy scene to run for a Vampire game — if done poorly, it can be tedious, awkward, or leave the other players bored. So, rather than one technique you can use, as with the previous sections, we’ve given you a variety of options you can use, depending on what effect you’re going for. You can stick with one method that your group likes, or change and adapt based on the current needs of your chronicle.</p><p></p><h2>Quick-And-Dirty Scenes: The One-Roll Method</h2><p>The default method for hunting is detailed in Chapter Six on p. 259. It basically boils down to a single dice roll — success means the vampire gets blood, while failure means she doesn’t, and a botch introduces a complication. And, as a high-level scene, that works just fine. If your story is in the middle of a lot of different plots and twists and the players really just want to fuel up and get back into things, a quick dice roll or two combined with a short bit of narration does the trick. Unfortunately, this method can take a lot of the horror and monstrosity out of the act of drinking blood, turning it into merely numbers of points to be collected and spent as needed.</p><p></p><h2>Detailed Scenes: The Three-Stage Hunt</h2><p>In some situations, you might want to have the player go through each step of the hunt, playing through the conflict between hunter and prey. This method takes more time than the single-roll structure, but can be useful to help players get into the mindset of playing a vampire, to add a dash of complexity in an otherwise slow part of the story, or just to spend some more time digging into the nature of the hunt. In this case, you can break the scene down into three stages: the contact, the hunt, and the defeat.<br /><br />The <em>contact</em> is the stage in which the vampire looks for and finds a suitable target — scanning a dance floor for a lonely date, looking for a homeless person in an alleyway, scouring through sewers for a stray animal, and so on. The roll itself depends on what method of hunting the vampire is using, but it likely uses Perception, since the vampire is merely trying to find an appropriate target that looks vulnerable at this point. The difficulty varies, but the table on p. 260 that puts the range of difficulty at 4-8 is a good basis. Failure means that an appropriate target isn’t available that scene — either there’s no one around, or all of the potential victims are too well-protected or too visible to easily feed from. A botch at this stage isn’t too painful, probably indicating that security is unusually high, an unexpected party is going on, or there’s some other factor that keeps the vampire from feeding successfully in that area for the rest of the night.<br /><br />The <em>hunt</em> is when the vampire approaches and engages the victim, getting them into a position where the vampire can feed. At a nightclub, the vampire might use Subterfuge to flatter and seduce the victim into a private corner. In an alleyway, he might use Stealth to follow the homeless man into a dead end. And in the sewers, the vampire may use Animal Ken to be able to creep up on a rat without spooking it. The stakes are higher than the contact stage, but they aren’t too high yet: failure means that something is preventing the victim from being easily fed upon (the club girl won’t leave her friends, the homeless man gets hassled by a police officer, the rat scuttles back just out of reach), while a botch means that the victim avoids the approach, sending the vampire back to searching for a new victim.<br /><br />Finally, the <em>defeat</em> is when the vampire feeds: she nuzzles the neck of the club girl, shoves the homeless man against the wall, or makes a grab for the rat. At this point, the risk is high — success means blood (as much as the vampire wants to take, although you can say the vampire can’t have more blood points than the player scores successes), but failure means the victim escapes. A botch introduces a major complication at this point: the club kid screams and gets the attention of everyone on the dance floor, a policeman sees the assault and calls for backup, or the rat turns out to be some sort of were-creature.<br /><br />One way to help keep other players involved in this kind of lengthy scene is to have them play the part of the victim and associated characters, similar to a flashback. The victim is roleplayed based on the vampire player’s rolls. This can not only help to get more players involved, but also add a level of emotional intimacy to the scene as the other players help to add life to this encounter.</p><p></p><h2>Poignant Scenes: Flashes of Life</h2><p>If you want to introduce an element of humanity into the hunt, you can use this quick rule: For every success made on the hunting roll (either the one-roll scene or in stage three of the hunt), the player gets one image about the victim’s life, some emotional snapshot that flashes through the victim’s mind as they feel the blood leaving their body. These images can be like photographs spliced into the “film” of your game. Some examples:<br /></p><ul><li><p><em>A broken doll, dangling from a child’s hand.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The victim and his wife, laughing at the beach.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Holding the hand of a loved one as she lies in a hospital bed.</em></p></li><li><p><em>A beloved pet curled in the victim’s lap.</em></p></li></ul><p><br />This isn’t necessarily information the vampire would know (although some powers, such as Auspex and Thaumaturgy, might make it available) — the idea is to bring home to the player that their character is doing something terrible to a human being. You’ll probably want to keep a list of random elements on hand to use for these scenes, so you don’t have to improvise at the table.<br /><br />For an additional level of emotional impact, you can organize the images based on the style of feeding the vampire is doing. An aggressive vampire attempting to intimidate his victim might result in scenes of violence from the victim’s past, while a more seductive scene may bring uncomfortable moments of intimacy.</p><p></p><h2>Narrative Scenes: Something Always Goes Wrong</h2><p>If a player really wants his character to get blood, he can volunteer the vampire for a narrated feeding scene. Effectively, the player is choosing to forgo the dice roll for hunting, gaining as many blood points as the Storyteller will allow. In return, however, something in the hunting scene <em>will</em> go wrong, as if the vampire’s player had rolled a botch. The scene should be played out as normal, but until the complication sets up, there’s no need to roll the dice — the fate of the vampire is now set on a particular path. These scenes add a level of tension because they are usually called for by the player: The situation is desperate enough that the blood is necessary, and the player is willing to accept the consequences. It also ties into the undercurrent of nihilism in Vampire — there is no situation that can’t get worse.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"journal-backlinks":{"references":[]}},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"sort":1200000,"name":"Frenzy and Rötschreck","type":"text","_id":"ul75wsddHJKbp8oS","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>[V20 pg. 297]</p><p><br />[…] A vampire in frenzy gains several temporary benefits from the state.

All difficulties to Dominate or otherwise mentally control a frenzied character are increased by two, and all difficulties to resist the effects of such mental control are reduced by two.

A vampire on the verge of frenzy must make a Self-Control roll against a variable difficulty. (Vampires with the Instincts Virtue always frenzy — see p. 315 for more). The difficulty is often 6 to 8, but if trying to overcome the urge to commit a blatantly evil act, the vampire’s player can roll against a difficulty of (9 minus Conscience) instead. The character must score five successes to completely overcome the desires for violence, but even one success halts the frenzy temporarily. For each success below five, the character can resist the urge to frenzy for one turn. After this duration expires, the character may try again to gain extra successes and thus continue to resist the frenzy. Once five successes are acquired, over a longer or shorter period, the vampire resists the Beast’s urges.<br /></p><blockquote><p>Self-Control - [V20 pg. 120]</p><p>[…] Self-Control allows the character to resist the frenzy.

Sunlight and fire can bring about a terrified flight-or-fight mentality. While under the spell of this Rötschreck, a vampire flees in blind panic from the source of her fear, frantically lashing out at anything in her way regardless of any personal attachments or affiliations. Rötschreck is in most ways similar to any other frenzy; just as the Beast sometimes seizes control in times of anger, so it does in times of great fear.<br /><br />[…] A vampire seeking to avoid Rötschreck requires a Courage roll.

In general, the effects of most drugs on vampires are far less than their effects on humans.<br /></p><ul><li><p><strong>Alcohol:</strong> The vampire subtracts one from Dexterity and Intelligence dice pools for every two drinks’ worth of alcohol in his victims’ blood. This effect fades at the rate of one die per hour, as the alcohol purges itself from the bloodstream.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cocaine/meth/speed:</strong> Vampires with the Celerity Discipline gain an extra level of the Discipline for (10 minus Stamina) minutes after drinking. Difficulties to resist or control frenzy are increased by one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hallucinogens:</strong> The vampire lowers all dice pools by one to three (inability to concentrate). He suffers effects similar to the Level Two Dementation power The Haunting.

Difficulties of frenzy rolls are decreased by one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Marijuana:</strong> The vampire experiences a slightly altered perception of time, as well as a one-die reduction to Perception dice pools. Difficulties of frenzy rolls are decreased by one, due to the calming effect of the drug. The effects last for about half an hour.</p></li><li><p><strong>Poison:</strong> The vampire subtracts one from all dice pools and takes from one to three levels of lethal damage per scene or even turn, depending on the intensity of the poison. Few poisons have any real effect on the undead, and most inflict a fixed maximum amount of damage before wearing off. The vampire may purge the blood at his normal expenditure rate, and the effects heal automatically within minutes to hours after purging the blood.</p></li><li><p><strong>Salmonella (food poisoning):</strong> The vampire becomes nauseated, unable to consume more blood (roll Stamina, difficulty 6, to overcome), and suffers one health level of bashing damage.

The more time spent musing, the more remarkable the finished product.<br /></p><blockquote><p><strong>Musing Threshold Table</strong></p><p><strong>Inspire Creativity:</strong> The character wants to inspire creativity in all those around him, especially those who have the potential to become great artists. He may try to inspire multiple artists at a time to work together to create a great piece of shared art. Working together, especially on a shared vision, can be held together by the inspiring changeling who can keep them on track.</p><p><strong>Create Hope:</strong> An optimist at heart, the character tries to inspire hope in others. He may help someone out of a situation that seems hopeless or find a new solution for the Dreamer that has lost hope and belief in herself. Even in horrible circumstances, greatness can be brought forth when someone has been given hope.</p><p><strong>Create Love:</strong> The character believes that any problem can be overcome by love. He may bring two lovers together or encourage a discouraged romantic to give love one more try. This may involve a lot of listening and making suggestions and encouragement. As long as the subject tries, and listens to the character’s advice, the musing works.</p><p><strong>Create Calm:</strong> The character believes that calming one’s spirit can resolve most situations. She tries to keep the Dreamer calm and cool to enable the subject to assess herself and gain insight into her problems so she may relax enough to create.</p><p><strong>Foster Trust:</strong> The changeling thinks the world can be a better place if people have faith in one another, extending their trust and getting involved with shared projects and interests.</p><p><strong>Help Those in Need:</strong> Some need help or guidance. Those who are addicts or who are abused need inspiration to give up their addiction or stand on their own feet so they can Dream again.</p><p><strong>Foster Dreams:</strong> The character inspires people to dream of things they want to achieve, convincing them that if they dream hard enough, those things can come true.</p></blockquote><p><strong><br />Roll Manipulation + an Ability that suits the situation,</strong> […] <strong>The difficulty is 6.</strong> The changeling gains Glamour equal to her successes. […] <strong>If the roll fails,</strong> the character must spend another week studying her subject before trying again. <strong>If it botches,</strong> she has pushed the Dreamer too hard; the Dreamer rejects the idea entirely and falls into a creative block. Should that happen, the Dreamer loses the creative urge temporarily. The Storyteller should roll the appropriate <strong>Attribute + Ability (difficulty 6)</strong> for the Dreamer and compare the result to the chart above to determine how long it will be before the artist can be inspired again. The character attempting to act as a muse for the Dreamer must start from scratch.</p><p>The changeling does not have to act as a muse in accordance with her Musing Threshold, but if she does, and the player rolls five successes or more on the final musing roll, the character <strong>gains a dot of Glamour!</strong><br /></p><h2>Rapture (The Path of Self-Inspiration)</h2><p>[…] Use the chart for the basic time it takes to muse a mortal and apply it to the fae attempting Rapture. Roll Perception + Kenning (difficulty 8) just as with mortals. […]</p><p>Once this time has passed, the player makes a roll on an appropriate Attribute + Ability (difficulty 6 + banality - glamour).</p><p>The number of successes rolled equals the amount of Glamour the character gains. If the player rolls <strong>five or more successes, the character gains a dot Glamour</strong> and refills her pool entirely! A botch is a confidence-shattering failure, causing the character to gain a point of Banality. If the character wants to try again, he must wait at least a week and start over from scratch.<br /></p><h2>Ravaging (The Path of Theft)</h2><p>The Kithain must establish a relationship with the target, but this relationship doesn’t need to be close or genuine. The changeling needs to know the target’s name and something about her inspirations — what causes her to want to create. The player rolls a number of <strong>dice equal to his character’s Banality (difficulty 6)</strong>. The character gains Glamour points equal to the successes. If the Ravaging roll <strong>fails,</strong> the character gains no Glamour and gains a point of Banality. If the roll is a <strong>botch,</strong> the character gains a dot of Banality as the Ravaging backfires and rips into his own psyche.<br /></p><blockquote><p><strong>Ravaging Thresholds Table</strong></p><p><strong>Exhaust Creativity:</strong> The character delights in exploiting others, mocks those with more talent, and even hires them to create for him, but disparages what the Dreamer makes. The art created this way is tainted, corrupted, or wasted. This burns out the Dreamer and he is left wondering why he wasted his time.</p><p><strong>Destroy Hope:</strong> The character seeks to induce despair in the Dreamer. He stands by and lets the Dreamer sink, refusing to help or even mocking her efforts to reignite any hope she has lost. He may talk her out of taking actions to improve her life by pointing out how useless they are.</p><p><strong>Destroy Love:</strong> The character blocks his target from experiencing love. He gains strength from preventing others from finding it. He has several ways of breaking up lovers, from seducing one of them to fabricating lies or “evidence” that one’s significant other is cheating. As long as the prey’s attempts to find love are foiled the Ravaging succeeds.</p><p><strong>Create Anger:</strong> The character prides himself on his own self-control, but delights in driving others to frustration and anger. By wearing down his target’s self-esteem and self-control, he drives the prey to self-destructive, violent acts.</p><p><strong>Break Trust:</strong> The character has had his trust broken and now must visit that feeling on others. He works to sow distrust between two or more people. Eventually, he causes his victim to lose trust in everyone else and isolate himself from the world.</p><p><strong>Exploit Dependence:</strong> The character prides herself on her self-sufficiency and tries to force others to become dependent on her. These might be neglected children, runaways, addicts, or those who crave her love. Ultimately, she destroys anyone who depends on her by walking away once the victim is firmly “hooked.”</p><p><strong>Destroy Illusions:</strong> The character is jaded. Innocence disgusts him. He might talk up something the victim believes in, then yank the rug out and laugh at the prey for being a fool to believe in anything. Childlings might prey on other kids by getting them in trouble or by revealing the truth about Santa and the Easter Bunny.</p></blockquote><p><br />[…] The system is the same as for Reverie, except that on that path if the player rolls five or more successes on the roll, the character <strong>gains a dot of Glamour.</strong> This is not possible for Ravaging unless the character pursues a threshold.</p><p></p><h2>Revelry (The Path of the Kith)</h2><p>A character can indulge in Revelry once per story. She must spend at least a scene in Revelry, and the player must describe the character’s Revelry to the Storyteller. When the Revelry ends, the character completely refills her Glamour pool.</p><p></p><h2>Rhapsody (The Path of Destruction)</h2><p>One to five points of Glamour are invested into the artist; an entire motley can donate some and reap shares of the Rhapsody. The Storyteller rolls <strong>Manipulation + Expression (or another appropriate roll, difficulty 7)</strong> on behalf of the mortal to create the masterpiece, <strong>adding dice equal to the number of Glamour</strong> the changeling invests. […]</p><p>[…] The Glamour within it isn’t released until the creation is destroyed. […] When the creation is destroyed, all changelings present split the released Glamour among them […]</p><p>If the roll <strong>fails,</strong> the artist never finishes the creation. Pumping further Glamour into her simply confuses her; she is unable to create (or rather, finish creating anything) for a number of months equal to the invested Glamour.</p><p>If the roll is a <strong>botch,</strong> the changelings get their comeuppance in a terrible way, but the artist suffers as well. For every 1 rolled on the botch, the creator gains a dot of Banality. No one gains any Glamour. This means the changeling faces the possibility of not only losing Glamour, but that the artist may become too entrenched in Banality to remain connected to the Dreaming. Again, the Dreamer can never create again and the changelings have destroyed the mortal’s gift for nothing.<br /></p><h2>*Sacrifice a Dot</h2><p>[C20 pg. 173]</p><p>A changeling may sacrifice a dot of Glamour to regain a number of temporary points equal to the new permanent rating.<br /></p><h2>Dross</h2><p>[C20 pg. 259]</p><p><strong>Dross:</strong> This does not restore Glamour, per se, but can be spent in place of Glamour<br /></p><p>[C20 pg. 320]</p><p><strong>Optional Rule: Harvesting Dross</strong></p><p>[…] The player <strong>rolls Glamour, difficulty 7.</strong> Successes indicate the amount of dross harvested, and rolls may be made once per turn.

(“hurt that man,” “save my friend,” “restore the grove”). She spends two points of Glamour and adds one to her character’s Nightmare rating. The player is not constrained by the character’s Realms. Unleashed Glamour can affect anything, regardless of the caster’s knowledge of Realms.</p><p>The player rolls a number of dice equal to the character’s Glamour rating plus a number of dice equal to her Nightmare rating (difficulty 7). This is an exception to the usual rule about other Traits being added to Tempers (p. 244). If the roll succeeds, the player must compare the number of successes to the rating of the Unleashed Art (see below).</p><p><strong>If the roll is a botch,</strong> the Dreaming floods through the character completely unchecked until Banality violently responds to the breach of the Mists. The character gains an Imbalance (but does not reduce her Nightmare dice pool as a result) and the Unleashed Art causes havoc around her for one turn. At the beginning of the next turn, Banality responds and cuts the character off from the Dreaming. The character suffers a <strong>Banality trigger,</strong> and she cannot spend Glamour or use Arts for the remainder of the scene.</p><p><strong>If the roll fails,</strong> the character is unable to Unleash. This <strong>triggers Banality,</strong> and the character cannot use the Unleashed Art for the remainder of the scene.</p><p><strong>If the roll succeeds,</strong> but garners a number of successes equal to or fewer than the character’s Art rating, the changeling successfully invokes and controls the Dreaming. The character automatically invokes the Wyrd for a number of turns equal to her Glamour (the player can spend a point of Willpower to make it last for the rest of the scene), her fae mien becomes visible, and the player narrates the effect of the Unleashed Art.</p><p><strong>If the player rolls more successes than the Art rating,</strong> though, the character loses control. The character’s intent is fulfilled, but in a twisted or unintended way that adds complications or puts everyone nearby at risk. The character gains one Nightmare, and the Storyteller narrates the effect of the Unleashing and should incorporate a complication or conflict into the result. The character automatically invokes the Wyrd for the remainder of the scene.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"journal-backlinks":{"references":[]}},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"sort":12500,"name":"Healing","type":"text","_id":"liAUp0kqZCQtdHi7","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>[C20 pg. 291]</p><p></p><p><strong>Physical Healing Times</strong></p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Bashing</strong></td><td><strong>Lethal</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Bruised</td><td>One Hour</td><td>One Day</td></tr><tr><td>Hurt</td><td>One Hour</td><td>Three Days</td></tr><tr><td>Injured</td><td>One Hour</td><td>One Week</td></tr><tr><td>Wounded</td><td>One Hour</td><td>One Month</td></tr><tr><td>Mauled</td><td>Three Hours</td><td>Three Months</td></tr><tr><td>Crippled</td><td>Six Hours</td><td>Three Months</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacitated</td><td>12 Hours</td><td>Five Months</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p><strong>Chimerical Healing Times</strong></p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Bashing</strong></td><td><strong>Lethal</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Bruised</td><td>30 Minutes</td><td>Six Hours</td></tr><tr><td>Hurt</td><td>30 Minutes</td><td>12 Hours</td></tr><tr><td>Injured</td><td>One Hour</td><td>One Day</td></tr><tr><td>Wounded</td><td>One Hour</td><td>Three Days</td></tr><tr><td>Mauled</td><td>One Hour</td><td>Five Days</td></tr><tr><td>Crippled</td><td>Three Hours</td><td>One Week</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacitated</td><td>Six Hours</td><td>Three Weeks</td></tr></tbody></table><p> <br /></p><p><strong>Aggravated Damage</strong></p><p>Certain sources of damage, chimerical or physical, cause injuries that are qualitatively worse than others.

Aggravated damage must heal at the natural rate, and cannot be enhanced by magic.

Members of Aesin can speak with forest animals (non-domesticated wildlife like squirrels, bears, deer, etc.). To understand an animal, the player rolls Intelligence + Empathy (difficulty 8).</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />Aesin fae have not adjusted well to the life of mortal flesh. They view humans as servants, though loyal ones occasionally worthy of the Aesin’s defense, and cannot reconcile themselves with the unpleasant reality of their own human bodies. Because of this disconnect between their fae and mortal natures, fae from House Aesin are unable to gain Glamour through Rapture.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Ailil (Ay-LEEL)</strong></p><p><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Dragons, Liars (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />Even the noblest members of House Ailil still have a way with words, and their politicians and deceivers never seem to be caught out like others of their kind. Dragons subtract 1 from the difficulty of all Manipulation rolls, and can never botch a Subterfuge or Politics roll.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />Ailil believe that they are the smartest ones in the room. A Dragon must make a Willpower roll, difficulty 8, to directly admit being wrong or let someone else have the last word in a heated situation. If an Ailil admits he is wrong, loses a contest of wits or skill, or backs down from a heated confrontation, he cannot regain Willpower points and suffers a +1 penalty on the difficulty of all Social rolls until he restores face somehow. This can mean getting revenge on his opponent or simply (unfairly) berating his lessers until he feels better.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Balor (BAY-lor)</strong></p><p><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Blooded, Monsters (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />The Blooded’s willingness to accept even the most unpleasant tasks without complaint is made manifest in their house boon, along with one of the prime reasons they are so widely feared by other fae. While touching cold iron causes a Balor mild discomfort, she does not lose Glamour from handling it, nor from being struck by it. Members even have a slim chance to soak damage from cold iron sources (difficulty 10). However, cold iron still inflicts aggravated damage on the Blooded, and death by cold iron destroys a Balor’s soul the same as any other changeling.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />All members of House Balor are marked by sinister deformities, and wear them proudly. Balor fae tend toward freakish traits such as forked tongues, glowing eyes, over-long limbs, scales or fur instead of hair, and other markedly unnatural characteristics. A Blooded’s deformity might be temporarily concealed, but can never be permanently corrected, not even with magic. Sidhe of House Balor are born with these traits, displaying mortal versions of them even before their Chrysalis, while other fae who take titles in the house later on in life inevitably develop them as part of the Blooded’s secret initiation rites.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Danaan (Da-NON)</strong></p><p><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Pathfinders, Lost (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />House Danaan members can withstand the rigors of life in the Dreaming far better than most Kithain. Pathfinders are in no danger of Bedlam from simply living in the Dreaming, even for extended periods of time. They are also experts at finding and navigating trods. Danaan members can never botch a roll involving locating, opening, or navigating a trod. A player may also spend one point of Glamour to have her character locate the Silver Path after a full minute of contemplation, provided it has not been magically concealed.</p><p>Once per session, a player of a House Danaan character may spend one Glamour point to invoke the Oath of the Dragon for a scene, allowing the player to add the character’s Title rating to all Social rolls related to chimera and other inhabitants of the Dreaming. While under this effect, a Pathfinder may converse normally with such beings, even feral chimera (within the limits of their intelligence). By ancient and sacred oath, chimera and natives of the Dreaming will not attack a Danaan under this effect, even if magically commanded, though this effect is immediately and permanently broken for any witnesses if the Pathfinder breaks faith and attacks, abuses, or trespasses against such beings, or orders others to do so. Cantrips and Birthrights count as attacks for the purpose of this effect, unless specific consent is granted for their use.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />Due to their deep ties to the Dreaming, Danaan suffer from a curious version of the Mists when it comes to the Autumn world. Any dramatic moment where a Danaan must remember an important detail about her mortal life or the mundane world in general, from where she left her keys to where she works to her girlfriend’s name, the player must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8). This difficulty may vary based on factors such as the obscurity of the information and how much pressure the Pathfinder is under. A botch on this roll means the information is lost completely, and must be relearned anew. In addition, a similar Willpower roll must be made each full week the Danaan spends in the Dreaming, with failure meaning some memory of the mortal world slips away until properly refreshed (or relearned outright).</p><p>This memory loss does not cause a Danaan to lose Abilities or Backgrounds — she won’t forget how to Drive, for instance, though she might not remember who taught her — but could impact difficulties on relevant rolls at the Storyteller’s discretion. A player may choose to add her character’s Banality rating to this roll, at the cost of accepting one Banality point.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Daireann (Dar-RAWN)</strong></p><p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Hosts, Cauldron-keepers</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />House Daireann dedicates itself to the laws of Honor, Hospitality, and Vengeance. Members of this house receive a minus one difficulty to all rolls specifically pertaining to protecting someone under their hospitality, or when enacting vengeance against someone who has violated their hospitality.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />Members of House Daireann cannot turn away someone seeking shelter or asylum, even a mortal enemy, unless the person violates Daireann’s rules of hospitality.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Leanhaun (Lee-ANN-an)</strong></p><p><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Muses, Incubi/Succubi (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />The Muses are unnaturally charismatic. Leanhaun receive a free dot of Charisma, even if this takes them above 5. A Muse can also focus the full force of her charms on one person; all Social rolls involving that individual are at –1 difficulty, as are any rolls to gather Glamour involving that person. A Leanhaun can only target one individual this way per scene.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />House Leanhaun members age rapidly when denied access to fresh mortal Glamour. Each week a Leanhaun does not gain Glamour from a Dreamer, she effectively ages one year. Glamour gained from Reverie or Rapture reverses such aging at a rate of 1 year for every 5 points gained, while Glamour from Ravaging cancels one year per point gained, and Glamour from Rhapsody restores 5 years per point. Revelry does not restore youth at all. Note that a Muse cannot become younger than her actual age by infusion of Glamour; any “excess” rejuvenation is lost. This aging carries over to the mortal seeming, meaning Leanhaun must monitor their Glamour acquisition carefully to avoid arousing suspicion.</p><p>This unnatural aging toll is suspended for Leanhaun living in freeholds or the Dreaming, and does not apply to those who have yet to experience their Chrysalis or whose fae seemings are currently slumbering (such as from chimerical death or being permanently Undone). Of course, spending a lot of time in freeholds or the Dreaming holds problems of its own, but sometimes a desperate Leanhaun finds it necessary to stave off advancing age.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Varich (VAH-rik)</strong></p><p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Weavers, Puppetmasters (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />House Varich’s greatest strength is their ability to discern patterns and make predictions. They can look at a week’s worth of stocks and predict the market, observe a game of cards and predict who has what hand, watch a duel and predict the outcome. They require time and preparation, but once the Puppetmasters see the pattern, manipulating it comes easily. If the character has an opportunity to analyze his opponent in advance of a competition or conflict (such as fighting, sports, chess, etc.), the player can roll Perception + Kenning (difficulty 8) to successfully analyze his target’s pattern of play in that specific type of competition. While in that conflict with the target, all rolls against the target pertaining to the specific challenge have a –1 difficulty.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />Broken-hearted Varich vowed never to love again, and his house followed suit. Their perspective allows them to see the entire pattern and to manipulate it, but forces them to remain outside of it themselves, disconnected from others. They can never swear an oath of love to another, and the difficulty of Empathy rolls increases by one.</p><p></p><h2>Seelie Houses</h2><p><strong>House Beaumayn (BEAU-main)</strong></p><p><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Dark Stars, Hopeless (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />Dark Stars have uncanny senses, particularly when it comes to the nuances of the enchanted world. Beaumayn receive a free dot of Perception, even if it takes them above 5. In addition, they receive –1 to the difficulty of Kenning rolls, –2 if they involve Thallain, and cannot botch a Kenning roll.</p><p>Additionally, once per story the Storyteller may decree that a Beaumayn receives a prophetic vision or dream. The exact nature of these prophecies varies, but as the house’s reputation suggests they typically focus on dark or disturbing events — deaths, betrayals, disasters, and so on. While they can be symbolic or represent multiple possible outcomes, these visions are never outright deceptive, and always contain some useful information. Interpreting these dreams for maximum benefit requires an Intelligence + Enigmas roll, with a difficulty equal to 9 minus the Beaumayn’s Remembrance rating.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />It’s said that the abyss gazes back if you stare into it too long, and House Beaumayn is living proof. Thallain and members of the Shadow Court can sense the presence of members of House Beaumayn with a Perception + Kenning roll (difficulty 7), with success indicating that they are aware of the noble’s presence. This will not reveal the exact location of a hidden Beaumayn, though it could definitely prompt a search. Unless given compelling and immediate reasons otherwise, Thallain and Shadow Court members instinctively go out of their way to harass, torment, and even outright harm Beaumayn members whenever possible. As a rule of thumb, this animosity should come up at least once per story, if not more often.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Dougal (DOO-gul)</strong></p><p><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Smiths, Broken (derogatory)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />House Dougal members inherit some of their founder’s iron resolve, as well as the legendary talents of their ancestors. Once per story, a Smith may convert Glamour points to Willpower points, or vice versa, provided they are engaged in some difficult and consuming creative or physical endeavor — forging an item, carving a sculpture, locked in battle, shut away painting, enduring a grueling athletic contest, etc. In addition, once per session a player may spend a point of Glamour to subtract 2 from the difficulties of all Crafts rolls for the rest of the scene, as her Smith channels the skills and insights of her forbears.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />Craftsmanship is so much a part of the Smiths that their own bodies gradually change to incorporate it. For each level of the Title Background a member purchases, a part of her body is replaced with a fully-functional artificial component: a clockwork eye, a stained-glass heart, a steam-powered brass hand, etc. Many Smiths forge and replace their own components, while others simply find their bodies changing over time. Acquiring these replacements is part of assuming a title in this house and does not require a roll or pose a threat to the Dougal. As they are fully-functional components, these replacements are not necessarily evident in a Dougal’s mortal seeming, unless the mortal seeming has need of a prosthetic. A Smith who loses a hand in a car accident, for instance, might have a mundane prosthetic as well as a chimerical replacement.</p><p>In game terms, these replacement parts provide no innate mechanical benefits, though they could potentially be used to justify purchasing related Merits or even Treasures. However, for every two replacements a character possesses (round up), she suffers a –1 penalty to all dice pools related to Animal Ken, Empathy, and Subterfuge, as her increasingly artificial nature makes it harder to relate to others. In addition, a replacement part stops functioning if it comes in direct contact with cold iron; such failures inflict penalties or even damage as the Storyteller feels appropriate. A hand that stops functioning would inflict dice penalties on tasks requiring manual coordination, for example, while an iron collar around an artificial throat might inflict damage as the character begins suffocating.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Eiluned (El-EE-ned)</strong></p><p><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Sorcerers, Sneaks (unflattering)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />Magic comes naturally to the members of House Eiluned. Players can roll Perception + Kenning to not only identify the Art and Realm of a cantrip or Unleashing, but also to determine the identity of the caster. They can pick the source of the magic out of a crowd or, if they are familiar with the caster, recognize the “signature” of the cantrip. House Eiluned also enjoys a –1 difficulty for all Gremayre rolls.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />House Eiluned thirsts after mystery and intrigue, and their curiosity often leads them into dangerous situations. They’re also notorious meddlers, eager to put their fingerprints on everyone else’s business. If a member of this house comes across a locked door, password-protected system, or something else being kept hidden, they must try to discover the secret. If they choose not to investigate, the player gains one point of Nightmare.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Fiona (Fee-OH-nuh)</strong></p><p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Lions, True Hearts, Gossips (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />Those swearing fealty to House Fiona are truly courageous, and fear holds no power over them. Even in the face of certain defeat, Fiona’s legendary reckless bravery continues to shine. As such, any attempt to generate fear in them, magical or natural, automatically fails. The only thing that can truly inspire fear in a member of Fiona is a direct threat to the life and safety of her lover; these attempts are not subject to automatic failure.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />Fiona’s passions easily become obsessions, and their recklessness in the face of peril quickly transforms into seeking out danger for danger’s sake. A sidhe of this house finds ways to make even the more mundane passions, like food or drink, into hazardous activities — she’s the one eating the deadly fugu sashimi or challenging the troll twice her size to a drinking contest. In romance, especially, Fiona’s passionate nature attains lofty heights, with epic love affairs that often end in tragedy. When a member of House Fiona backs down from a challenge in order to avoid risk, they lose one Willpower.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Gwydion (GWID-ee-ohn)</strong></p><p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Falcons, Proud (unflattering)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />House Gwydion holds itself to a high standard, striving to be open and honest in its reign. They expect no less from those around them. Members of House Gwydion can sense whether someone is speaking the truth or telling a lie with a successful Perception + Kenning roll vs the liar’s Manipulation + Subterfuge. House Eiluned, the House of Secrets, is immune to this power.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />House Gwydion has clung to the Dreaming and the society that used to be more dearly than any other house that returned to Concordia during the Resurgence. A Gwydion’s honor is paramount, and she will not forget a slight, nor will she forgive it. If anyone insults the honor of a Gwydion or her house, the Gwydion must take revenge commensurate with the slight before the next sunrise or suffer a Banality trigger.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Liam (LEE-um)</strong></p><p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Monks, Oathbreakers (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />House Liam holds a particular affinity with mortals and those in pain, taking on burdens others cannot bear. If a member of House Liam lays hands upon a mortal, his player can spend one Glamour to reduce the mortal’s Banality by one. Likewise, if he lays hands upon another changeling, his player can spend one Glamour to reduce the changeling’s Nightmare by one.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />House Liam’s ties to mortals carry a price. Liam characters begin with one additional dot of Banality. Members of House Liam are also unable to Ravage for Glamour.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>House Scathach (SKAH-huh)</strong></p><p><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Gray Walkers, Killers (vulgar)</p><p><strong>Boon</strong><br />The Gray Walkers excel at all forms of close combat, and seem to have a preternatural skill at going unnoticed. They make no sound when fighting unless they choose to do so, and receive a –1 difficulty on all Stealth rolls. A Scathach can never botch a Stealth roll. In addition, due to their intense combat focus, all Gray Walkers receive +1 die on all Brawl and Melee rolls, as their perception of time seems to slow down, making it easy to land hits and avoid return strikes.</p><p><strong>Flaw</strong><br />All Scathach suffer from a bad reputation with most of their fellow nobles, as well as commoners with royalist sympathies. All Social rolls with other nobles or royalist commoners are made at a +2 difficulty; nobles from houses Liam and Danaan are exempt from this rule. By ancient pact, Gray Walkers who are Autumn sidhe or members of other kiths are also forbidden to use Sovereign, a ban backed by the full weight of the Dreaming. In general, known Scathach are typically the first investigated if notable thefts or deaths occur among the nobility, particularly if it appears to be a sophisticated or polished job.</p><p>Arcadian sidhe do not suffer the Sovereign restriction, but have trouble tempering their battle lust, requiring six successes on an extended Willpower roll (difficulty 7) to break off from combat once engaged. A botch on this roll wipes away all accumulated successes and delays a new roll for one round, and a player of a Scathach may only spend Willpower for an automatic success on this roll once per combat.
