You&rsquo;re the very opposite of &ldquo;arcane,&rdquo; which is why this Flaw was originally described as an adversarial Background for the Trait of that name; rather than moving through life with near-invisibility, you stand out like a HIT Mark at a Verbena barbeque.&nbsp;<br>Why are you memorable, exactly? Is it an inhuman glow behind your eyes? An unsettling tone in your voice? A metaphysical miasma that hangs about you despite your apparently mundane appearance? Does grass grow or die in your shadow? Maybe dogs cower when they sense your approach. There could be a low buzzing in your presence, like a chorus of flies, or a disconcerting crackle of electricity that radiates from your skin, disrupting electrical systems in small but noticeable ways. Whatever it is that causes people to remember you, that facet of your presence is a constant reminder that you are not like other folk.&nbsp;</p>","details":"<div class=\"textLayer\">Once again, the point-value of this Flaw depends upon the extent to which it interferes with your life:&nbsp;<br>\n<ul>\n<li>(2 points) It&rsquo;s pretty hard to conceal your oddities.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\nBy its nature, this Flaw represents an unmistakable impression. Each point in this Flaw adds one die to the dice pool of anyone who&rsquo;s trying to notice you, recognize you, or penetrate your attempts at stealth or concealment. (You didn&rsquo;t really think those wailing damned souls were gonna shut up just because you were trying to get past the guards, now did you?) You may, however, attempt to cover up your uncanny presence with a roll of Intelligence + Subterfuge, assuming you have a method of doing so &ndash; it&rsquo;s easier to conceal your glowing red eyes with sunglasses than to get those wailing damned souls to piss off for a few minutes! The difficulty of such attempts is generally 5 + the value of your Uncanny Flaw; if, for instance, the clever bioconstruct Victoria Carliotti gets two points in Uncanny for her too-perfect skin, rippling muscles, and impossibly green eyes, her concealment difficulty would be 7. That said, this Flaw does not increase the difficulty of social rolls and may, depending on what you&rsquo;re trying to do, decrease such difficulties instead (Storyteller&rsquo;s option).&nbsp;<br>Despite the potentially grotesque nature of this Flaw, your uncanniness doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to mean that your physical features are fearsome in themselves. An inhumanly gorgeous or disturbingly ordinary person can be Uncanny in their own ways. This Flaw makes an excellent companion to a variety of Physical Merits and Flaws &ndash; Enchanting Feature, Hyperflexible, Hideous, and so forth &ndash; and fits in with Backgrounds like Legend, Past Life or Totem quite well too. (See the appropriate entries for details.)&nbsp;<br>Although the Flaw: Echoes can manifest similar odd phenomena, this Flaw reflects a constant and recognizable distinction. While it probably embodies certain elements of your metaphysical practices, it&rsquo;s not tied to your Resonance or activities &ndash; it&rsquo;s an innate part of who you are. Your uncanniness could represent physical features (hulking physique, metallic skin, eyes that reflect eternity, and so forth); metaphysical quirks (an unearthly aura, echoing disembodied voices, a chilling radius around you, etc.); weird companions (a parade of pink-winged kittens, smoldering butterflies, howling coyote spirits, or similar inexplicable critters). Essentially, any sort of localized kink in normalcy&rsquo;s tail could be considered a sign of your Uncanny nature. By &ldquo;uncanny,&rdquo; incidentally, we don&rsquo;t necessarily mean &ldquo;supernatural.&rdquo; The unnatural stillness of a Black Suit, the flawless skin of a Victor, the predatory charisma of a Syndicate &ldquo;magic man&rdquo; &ndash; they&rsquo;re all examples of uncannily Enlightened technology.&nbsp;</div>","type":"wod.types.flaw","level":"2","value":0,"max":5,"isrollable":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Xm0gQOGizbwAWjul"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.IqlmEVFxrvGpqFAF","defaultPermission":2,"hash":"25cc7848354cae210faca550c037441f006018d1"},"cf":{"id":"temp_e4kmqu18uy4","path":"Flaws#/CF_SEP/Flaws, Additional#/CF_SEP/Uncanny","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.4.6","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672641076520,"modifiedTime":1677110472929,"lastModifiedBy":"WJobDcKVm0sBxNG2"},"_id":"IqlmEVFxrvGpqFAF","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"WJobDcKVm0sBxNG2":3}}

For you, however, the Avatar is a vibrant presence in your life, as real to you as anyone else. Essentially a character in its own right, this manifested Avatar interacts with you on an almost daily basis. In certain situations, it might interact with other people, as manifestly real as any other person in your world.&nbsp;</p>","details":"<div class=\"textLayer\">The Manifest Avatar Merit embodies the Avatar as a full character under the Storyteller&rsquo;s control. On its own, this Merit reflects that Avatar as a person who only the associated mage can see, hear, and interact with on a physical level; in conjunction with the Background: Allies, however, the Avatar becomes a character that everyone can see, hear, and feel. In both cases, the Avatar may come and go as it pleases, bound only by the physical laws with which it chooses to be bound. The physical Avatar&rsquo;s shell can be injured or killed, but that in itself does not kill the Avatar &ndash; merely its body. For obvious reasons, that solid Avatar should have a guise that won&rsquo;t be too vulgar or bizarre for the Consensus to endure &ndash; a cloaked, whispering figure, perhaps, but not a screeching, tentacled monstrosity. The manifested Avatar&rsquo;s Traits depend upon the value of the Allies Background, as well as the physical form of that incarnation. An equine or lupine Avatar, for instance, will have different Traits than an Avatar that manifests as a crow, shadow, mirror, or child.<br>Your Avatar does not hang a sign around her neck that proclaims Avatar. In the first edition Cult of Ecstasy Tradition Book, for example, Cassie deals with a manifested Avatar named Aria who never reveals herself to be anything other than a wild child who looks disturbingly like an alternate-reality version of Cassie and knows things no one else should know about Cassie&rsquo;s past, present, future, and inner self. (For details, see that book, pp. 5-45.) Unless either the mage or the Avatar announces its true identity, other characters don&rsquo;t usually think that your manifested Avatar is anything other than what it appears to be. Mages or Night-Folk who can see auras or souls might catch on, but most other folks remain clueless.&nbsp;<br>An Avatar manifesting only for the mage can affect the material world only when no other characters or devices can see that entity, although it might appear to others as an online presence, a ghostly figure, as odd sounds, or through other phenomena.

Everything seems overwhelming, pointless, and at best a fucking joke at the world&rsquo;s expense. That feeling pervades each aspect of your existence: your attitude, your physical health, your relationships, and even &ndash; especially! &ndash; your approach to magick and all its manifestations. (See the Mage 20 sections about Focus and the Arts, Resonance, Quiet, and the Vidare perceptions of the Otherworlds.) TL/DR: It really sucks to be you.&nbsp;<br><br></p>","details":"<p>Often viewed as a purely psychological issue (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in your pretty little head&hellip;&rdquo;), chronic depression tends to be linked to physiological Impediments, as in the Physical Flaw of that name. This Flaw can also reflect the psychic aftermath of Paradox backlashes, Quiet episodes, Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, Mind-Sphere attacks, and other forms of trauma (breakups, violation, disaster, and the like), although trauma-induced depression is most often a manifestation of the Flaw: PTSD, referenced above. Regardless of its origins, the psychological element of depression is inescapable. The emotional weight of constant despair tends to sap physical vitality, which comes back around and inspires more depression. No wonder chronically depressed people have a hard time &ldquo;living life to the fullest.&rdquo; On some days, just getting out of bed without falling into a crying heap is a challenge.&nbsp;<br>Story-wise, this Flaw influences roleplaying and character descriptions as suggested above. System-wise, it often requires you to make a Willpower roll when your depressed character needs to push himself beyond the depression. A successful roll means that he acts without hindrance. A failed one adds +2 to the difficulty of the primary task at hand, which could involve Attributes from the Physical (depression drains vitality), Social (undercuts relationships with other folks), or Mental (mental fuzz) categories, depending upon the situation. A botched roll means that the depression takes over and drops him into a deep black pit of despair in which he&rsquo;ll be stuck for hours or even days at a time.&nbsp;<br>You can spend a Willpower point to shove depression aside, avoiding this roll entirely. However, as anyone who understands the analogy of spoons can attest, sooner or later you run out of Willpower points. (For those who are not familiar with the analogy, it&rsquo;s the idea that you have a limited number of spoons to use each day; every task demands that you give up one spoon, and so you soon run out of spoons). The fact that people tend to get frustrated with your Black Cloud of Doom&trade; doesn&rsquo;t exactly help matters much; hell, you&rsquo;re more frustrated with that shit than anybody else is!

The difficulty of such attempts is generally 5 + the value of your Uncanny Flaw; if, for instance, the clever bioconstruct Victoria Carliotti gets two points in Uncanny for her too-perfect skin, rippling muscles, and impossibly green eyes, her concealment difficulty would be 7.

You&rsquo;re the very opposite of &ldquo;arcane,&rdquo; which is why this Flaw was originally described as an adversarial Background for the Trait of that name; rather than moving through life with near-invisibility, you stand out like a HIT Mark at a Verbena barbeque.&nbsp;<br>Why are you memorable, exactly? Is it an inhuman glow behind your eyes? An unsettling tone in your voice? A metaphysical miasma that hangs about you despite your apparently mundane appearance? Does grass grow or die in your shadow? Maybe dogs cower when they sense your approach. There could be a low buzzing in your presence, like a chorus of flies, or a disconcerting crackle of electricity that radiates from your skin, disrupting electrical systems in small but noticeable ways. Whatever it is that causes people to remember you, that facet of your presence is a constant reminder that you are not like other folk.&nbsp;</p>","details":"<div class=\"textLayer\">Once again, the point-value of this Flaw depends upon the extent to which it interferes with your life:&nbsp;<br>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 points) You scare people simply by existing.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"textLayer\">By its nature, this Flaw represents an unmistakable impression. Each point in this Flaw adds one die to the dice pool of anyone who&rsquo;s trying to notice you, recognize you, or penetrate your attempts at stealth or concealment. (You didn&rsquo;t really think those wailing damned souls were gonna shut up just because you were trying to get past the guards, now did you?) You may, however, attempt to cover up your uncanny presence with a roll of Intelligence + Subterfuge, assuming you have a method of doing so &ndash; it&rsquo;s easier to conceal your glowing red eyes with sunglasses than to get those wailing damned souls to piss off for a few minutes! The difficulty of such attempts is generally 5 + the value of your Uncanny Flaw; if, for instance, the clever bioconstruct Victoria Carliotti gets two points in Uncanny for her too-perfect skin, rippling muscles, and impossibly green eyes, her concealment difficulty would be 7. That said, this Flaw does not increase the difficulty of social rolls and may, depending on what you&rsquo;re trying to do, decrease such difficulties instead (Storyteller&rsquo;s option).&nbsp;<br>Despite the potentially grotesque nature of this Flaw, your uncanniness doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to mean that your physical features are fearsome in themselves. An inhumanly gorgeous or disturbingly ordinary person can be Uncanny in their own ways. This Flaw makes an excellent companion to a variety of Physical Merits and Flaws &ndash; Enchanting Feature, Hyperflexible, Hideous, and so forth &ndash; and fits in with Backgrounds like Legend, Past Life or Totem quite well too. (See the appropriate entries for details.)&nbsp;<br>Although the Flaw: Echoes can manifest similar odd phenomena, this Flaw reflects a constant and recognizable distinction. While it probably embodies certain elements of your metaphysical practices, it&rsquo;s not tied to your Resonance or activities &ndash; it&rsquo;s an innate part of who you are.
