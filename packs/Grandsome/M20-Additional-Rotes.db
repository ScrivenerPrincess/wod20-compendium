Despite such rumors, though, the realities involved in this sort of metamorphosis make the idea more theoretical than practical.\n\nVampires with the Protean and Vicissitude Disciplines can transform back to their original form with very little trouble. The vampire must spend one Blood Point for each success the mage rolled. Every point negates one success on the Arete roll, and the vampire changes back when those successes are all negated.\n\nThe transformed vampire is still a vampire, and that vampire remains conscious. Said vampire may use any Discipline that doesn’t require moving her limbs.\n\nThe vampire will flip her shit unless she makes a successful roll, and anyone within reach will become wallpaper in very short order.\n\nVampires hold immortal grudges. Any mage who transforms a Kindred into furniture will be blood-hunted by that vampire, her allies, and probably other vampires as well.\n","details":"","correspondence":0,"entropy":0,"forces":0,"life":5,"matter":5,"mind":0,"prime":0,"spirit":0,"time":0,"instrument":{"ispersonalized":false,"isunique":false},"spendingtime":"0","spelltype":"vulgar","isextended":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.ky3puBEinraP76Tb","defaultPermission":2,"hash":"bde46cddad704938d34a8dc4d4266dfd969e2342"},"cf":{"id":"temp_4ifmh949zfa","path":"Sorts (Rotes) Additionels#/CF_SEP/Mystic and Traditional Spells","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.4.6","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672622375469,"modifiedTime":1677110472666,"lastModifiedBy":"WJobDcKVm0sBxNG2"},"_id":"ky3puBEinraP76Tb","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"WJobDcKVm0sBxNG2":3}}
