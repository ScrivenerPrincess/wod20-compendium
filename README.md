# WoD20-Compendium
A Compendium for use with JohanFalt's [WoD 20 system](https://github.com/JohanFalt/Foundry_WoD20) for Foundry
Generated with kid1407's [Compendium2Module](https://github.com/kid2407/Compendium2Module)

# Hotfix Notes - VERY IMPORTANT
Foundry 11 introduced native support for compendium folders. This broke my previous methods of exporting compendiums for distribution here. You will notice that all previous compendiums are not organized in folders, and instead have everything dumped into the root compendium.

A simple, hot fox solution is as follows:

1. Install [Mana's Compendium Importer](https://gitlab.com/mkahvi/fvtt-compendium-importer)
2. Receive files from the [Hotfix Folder](https://github.com/SeaSaltSong/wod20-compendium/tree/main/Hotfix). (These can also be downloaded from the latest release)
3. Use Mana's Compnedium Importer to import the .json files for the available compendiums

This will keep folder structure and allow ease of use. This solution is temporary until I figure out how to maintain folder structure with the module.

In the mean time, this will still have the raw, unorganized compendiums still while I play with and manage them.

# Additional Modules
This module is by no means required, but can prove more useful depending on your game.
- KayelGee's [Moar Folders](https://github.com/KayelGee/moar-folders)
When using Moar Folders, set folder depth to 5. This will allow things such as the Necromancy discipline in V20 to be placed directly in disciplines, instead of being on its own.
