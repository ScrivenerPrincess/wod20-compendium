A Compendium for use with JohanFalt's [WoD 20 system](https://github.com/JohanFalt/Foundry_WoD20) for Foundry
Generated with kid1407's [Compendium2Module](https://github.com/kid2407/Compendium2Module)

# Additional Modules
This compendium was compiled and formatted with the following two compendiums and intended for use alongside with them. Not using them may result in poor formatting during use:
- earlSt1's [Compendium Folders](https://github.com/earlSt1/vtt-compendium-folders)
- KayelGee's [Moar Folders](https://github.com/KayelGee/moar-folders)

When using Moar Folders, set folder depth to 5

## Current Compendiums

- Select VtM Bloodline Disciplines
- Select VtM Lore of the Clans content

## Planned
I am working on compendiums for the games I am actively running/plan to run in the near future which influences the order of release. They are as follows:
- VtM - Lore of the Clans (Minus Elder disciplines)
- VtM Core: Bloodline Disciplines
- VtM Core: Elder Disciplines
- VtM - Lore of the Clans (Elder disciplines)
- VtM - Rites of the Blood

Then in no particular order:
